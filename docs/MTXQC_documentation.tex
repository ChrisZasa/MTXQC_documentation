\chapter{Preface}\label{preface}

Let's get started \ldots{}. this part is going to be written in the near
future.

\chapter{Introduction MTXQCvX documentation}\label{intro}

This documentation introduces to you how to use MTXQCvX2 in order to run
a first straight-forward data analysis of your metabolomics experiment.
The underling experimental and mathematical concepts have been
introduced for the pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM)
approach published in \citep{Pietzke2014}.

This documentation shows you how to use MTXQCvX2 in order to assess the
quality of your GC-MS derived data, perform the determination of
calibration curves and absolute quantification. It furthermore provides
you two normalisation strategies and the calculation of quantities in,
e.g., pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue.

MTXQCvX2 does also enable the calculation of stable isotopic
incorporation and the evaluation of the underlying data, the mass
isotopomer distributions (MIDs).

The tool has been set up to support the in-lab developed workflow for
quantitative metabolomics experiments using the in-house developed
software Maui for the annotation of data. MTXQCvX2 bridges the gap
between quality control and first data post-processing / analysis of
GC-MS derived data (MTXQCvX2\_part1, MTXQCvX2\_part2).

Nevertheless MTXQCvX2 includes a module in order to integrate all kind
of data provided in spreadsheet-format, e.g., derived from metmax,
extracting required information and creating corresponding files
(MTXQCvX2\_part4).

\section{Structure}\label{structure}

MTXQCvX2 contains a suite of modules is optimized to process GC-MS
derived data and processed either in Maui or Chromatof/Metmax. Workflows
for both approaches are introduced with step-by-step tutorials in
chapter \ref{maui} and \ref{metmax}.

Subsequently each MTXQCvX2 module is introduced in greater detail
including the list of processing parameter (chapter \ref{ExpSetup} -
\ref{Metmax}).

The configuration of MTXQCvX2 has been split into two categories - (1) a
general configuration \texttt{config\_files} and (2) metabolomics
specific parameters \texttt{config\_mtx}. Latter one is meant to provide
flexibility to adapt MTXQCvX2 to your needs. How to do so and what files
can be customizes is shown in chapter \ref{config}.

Workflow-specific processing methods applied in Chromatof are introduced
separately in the chapter \ref{mauiproc} and \ref{metmaxproc} including
all parameter as well as a short introduction.

The remaining chapter cover a chapter for frequently asked questions
(chapter\ref{FAQ}) that might give you a hint where to search for the
information you are looking for.

The appendix summarises technical reference material in the form of a
dictionary of tables (chapter \ref{tables}), protocols for the pSIRM
workflow \ref{psirm} and a complete distinct chapter listing protocols
(chapter \ref{protocols}) including standard and sample preparation and
derivatisation (chapter \ref{SampleExtraction} and \ref{Deriv}) and the
current setting of the GC-ToF-MS machine (chapter \ref{gcms}).

\section{How to use this
documentation}\label{how-to-use-this-documentation}

This documentation provides for each level the right starting point.
Complete newbies are highly suggested to start with one of the two
tutorials and following the step-by-step descriptions using the example
datasets. Also if you are using for the first time please go through to
the chapter once to be aware of all the steps that are required to
succeed.

Experienced users might be referred to the explanation of the individual
modules or to the how-to-guides for data processing and the FAQs
section.

\section{In detail}\label{indetail-maui}

\subsection{Create a R-project}\label{create-a-r-project}

R-projects provide a secure environment to handle your data from the
processing in MTXQCvX2 until the final reports and analysis. Think about
it as a big bubble containing and carrying all your data and analysis
savely from one place to the other undisturbed of the outside changes.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open R-studio and create a new project following:
  \texttt{File\ -\textgreater{}\ New\ project\ -\textgreater{}\ New\ Project\ -\textgreater{}\ New\ Directory}
  and call the directory \texttt{tutorial\_single\_maui} and the
  preferred subdirectory.
\item
  I recommend to start each project in a new session (tick the box at
  the bottom of the dialogue box).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Copy MTXQCvX2 template
files}\label{copy-mtxqcvx2-template-files}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Download the current version of MTXQCvX2 called fluffy
  adventure\footnote{github.com/ChrisZasada/fluffy\_adventure}
\item
  Open and extract the zip-folder
\item
  Copy all folders and files into your R-project
  'tutorial\_single\_maui`
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process
\texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_init.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_init.rmd}

The module \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd} performs two important steps: 1.
Check-up package installation 2. Creation of project-folder

The project folder is supposed to provide a tidy structure while data
processing and analysis and contains several pre-defined folder. Besides
the following folders: `input', `output' and `figures' you see a
detailed subfolder structure. You find more details about each folder
and additional suggestion how to use project-folder in chapter
\ref{init}.

All you need to do is to process the \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd}. The
following procedure is how you process all \texttt{.Rmd}-files of
MTXQCvX2:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Click on the small black triangle next to the ball of yarn in the
  R-Studio toolbar
\item
  Choose \texttt{Knit\ with\ Parameters...}
\end{itemize}

If the \texttt{.Rmd}-file contains defined parameters a shiny dialogue
pops up and provides an interactive selection based on the document. In
the case of \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd} you are asked to define a so-called
project-folder, e.g., \texttt{psirm\_glucose}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Define the name of the project-folder:} psirm\_glucose
\end{itemize}

Check in the files tab of R-Studio, browse through it and get familiar
with the structure. This is the home of your metabolomics projects data
analysis.

\subsection{Prepare and copy input
files}\label{prepare-and-copy-input-files}

Several files have to be exported from Maui and copied into the folders
\texttt{input/gc}, \texttt{input/quant} and \texttt{input/inc} for the
evaluation of the GC-MS performance, absolute quantification and isotope
incorporation.

Please follow the detailed instructions in section \ref{mauiexport} if
you need further information how to perform the export in Maui. For the
purpose of the tutorial the exported files are already processed and
provided in tutorial dataset \texttt{input}-folder. Select each file and
copy it to the correct location inside your R-project.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Copy files: \texttt{annotation.csv} and
\texttt{Sample\_extracts.csv}}{Copy files: annotation.csv and Sample\_extracts.csv}}\label{copy-files-annotation.csv-and-sample_extracts.csv}

Both files contain important information about your metabolomics
experiment and since these information are highly specific you need to
create them on your own and save them in \texttt{project-folder/input/}.

Browse to both files in the tutorial dataset, have a look at the content
and copy both files into \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input}.

\textbf{The annotation file}

The herein shown \emph{annotation file} contains information about the
eperimental conditions of each sample and measurement file. The columns
\textbf{File} and \textbf{Type} are mandatory and the minimum content of
an annotation file. Additional columns defining further conditions, like
cell line or glucose level, are totally customizable to your
preferences.

Though, I suggest to set up a maximum of four parameter. If your project
requires more try to create combinations. Later on this helps to
visualise your data using MTXQC\_part2. The number of parameters is
limited by the availabily of diagram axes, facets and paper size.
Subsequently written individual reports are independent of this and
conditions could be split and extended without any limitations.

\textbf{The sample extrats file}

The \emph{sample extracts} file specify the nature and volume / weight
of the sample extracts. The columns \textbf{Extract\_vol} and
\textbf{Unit} (count, mg or ul) are mandatory here.

The minimal file contains these two columns with at least one row /
entry, e.g. \(1.5e+6\) \& count. This would result into the association
of \(1.5e+6\) cells to each file.

This file here in this tutorial shows cell extracts defined with the
unit \emph{count} for specific conditions. Please be aware that names of
experimental conditions have to match between annotation and sample
extracts file.

Nevertheless it is not necessarily required to define for each
combination of conditions a cell count. Please refer FAQs section
\ref{createannotation} and \ref{createsampleextracts} for further
information how to create and set up both files from the scretch.

\subsection{Define an internal standard - cinnamic
acid}\label{define-an-internal-standard---cinnamic-acid}

The tutorials dataset contains data derived from a classical pSIRM
experiment. This includes that the experimentalist supplemented the
extraction solvent with an internal extraction standard - cinnamic acid.
All that we have to do is to check if this compound has been defined as
\texttt{InternalStandard} in the file
\texttt{config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolite.csv}.

To do so:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open the file: 'config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolite.csv`
\item
  Scroll down to the entry \texttt{Cinnamic\ acid\ trans-,\ 1TMS}
\item
  Verify that \texttt{InternalStandard} is defined in the column
  \texttt{Standard}
\item
  Save the file and close it
\end{itemize}

Read the section \ref{defineinternal} how to proceed in case you want to
define a different compound as internal standard.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process
\texttt{MTXQC\_ExperimentalSetup.csv}}{Process MTXQC\_ExperimentalSetup.csv}}\label{process-mtxqc_experimentalsetup.csv}

We are ready now to start processing the second module of the MTXQCvX2
called the Experimental Setup. In order to faciliate automated data
processing throughout MTXQC files and parameters have to be defined
beforehand for each project-folder.

Defined parameters are saved in the file \texttt{MTXQC\_params.csv}
inside the project-folder for future reference enabling to move the
project-folder independently of the remaining MTXQC-files. A huge
advantage for debugging and sharing your project\footnote{Just zip-file
  the project-folder and send it via mail.}

Define the following parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Define project-folder:} psirm\_glucose
\item
  \textbf{Define input-format:} maui
\item
  **Name of annotation \url{file:**} annotation.csv
\item
  **Name of sample extracts \url{file:**} sample\_extracts.csv
\item
  \textbf{Type of experiment:} pSIRM
\item
  \textbf{Applied 13C-substrates:} glc
\item
  \textbf{Internal standard:} check
\item
  \textbf{Type of samples:} cell extracts
\item
  \textbf{Additional calibration curves:} no
\item
  \textbf{Integrate add. calibration curves:} no
\item
  \textbf{Quantification standards:} Quant1\_v3
\item
  \textbf{Volume polar phase of Quants:} 500
\item
  \textbf{Technical replicates:}\footnote{Also called backups} no
\end{itemize}

Confirm the parameter and file definition and wait a moment. Check if
you can find the file \texttt{MTXQC\_params.csv} and also
\texttt{Maui\_params.csv}. Latter one is automatically generated by
selecting maui project as input format. \texttt{Maui\_params.csv}
contains the information of the pre-defined file names containing all
required input data.

Have a look at the produced pdf-file and check the comments and
messages. Throughout MTXQCvX2 messages inform about: * Successfull data
imports * Fatal errors causing an automatic stop of data processing and
* Warnings pointing towards things that should be checked before moving
to the next step.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process
\texttt{MTXQC\_part1.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_part1.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_part1.rmd}

Since we have defined all required input parameter the main module is
ready to run after the definition of only three parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition of the project-folder:} psirm\_glucose
\item
  **Type of \url{data:**} maui
\item
  **Manual validated \url{data:**} none
\end{itemize}

Also here, scroll carefully through the generated pdf-file and have a
look at the messages. If all works out it doesn't matter, but it might
help to know what should be written if you end up with an error message
instead of.

Each generated graphic is going to be explained in detail in chapter
\ref{part1}. For now please refer to my phd thesis \citep{Zasada2017}.

All quality metrices are visualised on the last page of the report split
into two heatmaps:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  GC-performance (orange): across all measurements
\item
  Quantification \& isotope incorporation (blue): for each intermediate
  individually, but across all exp. conditions
\end{itemize}

Besides the generation of the MTXQC\_part1 report several
\texttt{csv-files} are exported into the output folder summarising
statistics of all quality control metrices. The content of each file is
summarised in the dictionary of tables (chapter \ref{tables}).

The most important file \texttt{CalculationFileData.csv} summarises all
experimental conditions, normalisation factors as well as information
about calibration curve parameter and derived quantities. You find this
file here - \texttt{project-folder/output/quant/}.

It is worth to open this file in a program of your choice and check for
a selected intermediate the content. Wrong assignments of conditions in
the annotation or sample extracts-file might cause duplication of
values, easily to identify if exactly the same peak areas, so the same
file, appears multiple times.

\texttt{CalculationFileData.csv} is all about the absolute quantities
and data normalisation. Why does it not contain information about
isotope incorporation you might ask. Well, depending on the experimental
setup you might follow different ways how to combine both entities.
Furthermore \texttt{MTXQC\_part1} is not about doing any processing of
the data in the sense of analysis or statistics\footnote{Quality
  metrices are a different pair of shoes here and are not data per se}.
It is supposed to assess the quality meaning the evaluation of the mass
isotopomer distributions (MIDs) that are the basis for the calculation
of the isotope incorporation.

The next module has been set up to give you a first quick report about
the content of your data performing basic post processing steps
inclduing the statistics part.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process
\texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_part2.rmd}

This module aims to provide you a quick overview of your data. It
generates, based on your parameter definition while processing this
file, statistics of quantities for each intermediate as well as isotope
incorporation and 13C-labeled quantities.

A senseful association of your experimental parameter might provide you
even ready-to-show plots for a presentation or report. Different color
schemes are in place to meet your personal taste - play a bit and find
your favorite ;).

All kind of outputs (graphics, statistics) are saved at
\texttt{output/quant/...} into a day-specific folder\footnote{Called:
  Date\_PostProcessing\_AnalysisParam\_QuantitativeValue}, meaning if
you repeat the same analysis several times a day the content is replaced
with each run\footnote{Same thing for the generated pdf-report so I
  recommend to move it into the post processing folder for future
  reference}. Simply modify the folder name to avoid this behaviour. If
you go on with your analysis the next or another day a new folder is
created.

Go and process this module with the following parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Project-folder:} psirm\_glucose
\item
  \textbf{Type of analysis:} stringent
\item
  \textbf{Internal standard:} QC\footnote{meaning, that all the internal
    standard has to be within a defined range of variation, files with
    higher variation are excluded from the analysis}
\item
  \textbf{Quantitative value:} InstStd\_Conc\_pmio\footnote{Translated:
    Normalised (regarding the internal standard) quantities in
    (pmol/1e+6 cells)}
\item
  \textbf{par1:} time
\item
  \textbf{par2:} substrate
\item
  \textbf{par3:} whatelse
\item
  \textbf{par4:} none
\item
  \textbf{updated:} none
\item
  \textbf{pre-defined color scheme:} choose yourself
\end{itemize}

Feel free to add further plots at the end of this report if required or
define your project specific color code at the beginning of the
document.

I recommend to use the output of \texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd} as a kind of
overall visualisation of the data. Specific questions might be addressed
in smaller reports using the output-files of \texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}.

I furthermore suggest to process both type of analysis - stringent and
less stringent - to get an impression at what points the manual
validation of distinct intermediates might be useful.

\section{At the end\ldots{}}\label{at-the-end}

So far you have used MTXQCvX2 to generate two reports: 1. one
summarising the quality of the generated data and 2. a first statistical
overview about the content of your data.

With this the tutorial ends and refers to the plenty of detailed
information scattered in a number of additional chapters of this
documentation. The FAQ section tries to guide you through more specific
settings and introduces you to the flexibility of MTXQCvX2.

Since every metabolomics experiment has it's own purpose and reasoning I
want to point out, that MTXQCvX2 does not want to provide a magical tool
giving the perfect solution for everyone. It rather tries to provide a
common platform for discussions, information exchange and inspiration by
reducing the time that has to be spend on ``the boring part of
research''. There is no limit to make MTXQC your own perfect tool
writing your own reports and extensions. Feel free and hoepfully
motivated to share your report as a template with your colleagues.

The module \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd} performs two important steps: 1.
Check-up package installation 2. Creation of project-folder

The project folder is supposed to provide a tidy structure while data
processing and analysis and contains several pre-defined folder. Besides
the following folders: \texttt{input}, \texttt{output} and `figures´ you
see a detailed subfolder structure. You find more details about each
folder and additional suggestion how to use project-folder in chapter
\ref{init}.

All you need to do is to process the \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd}. The
following procedure is how you process all \texttt{.Rmd}-files of
MTXQCvX2:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Click on the small black triangle next to the ball of yarn in the
  R-Studio toolbar
\item
  Choose \texttt{Knit\ with\ Parameters...}
\end{itemize}

If the \texttt{.Rmd}-file contains defined parameters a shiny dialogue
pops up and provides an interactive selection based on the document. In
the case of \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd} you are asked to define a so-called
project-folder.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Define the name of the project-folder:} \texttt{t\_metmax}
\end{itemize}

Check in the files tab of R-Studio, browse through it and get familiar
with the structure. This is the home of your metabolomics projects data
analysis.

\subsection{Copy input files fom tutorial
dataset}\label{copy-input-files-fom-tutorial-dataset}

\texttt{MTXQC\_part4.Rmd} convienently transform spreadsheet kind of
data extracted with Metmax into suitable input files in the style of
Maui input files. You do not need necessarily provide all three kind of
information (peak areas, MIDs and m/z 73 values). It depends on the
scope and setup of your metabolomics experiment.

If you need detailed instructions how to use metmax have a look at the
section \ref{metmaxproc}. The input files of the tutorial dataset have
to be copied from `input/metmax/' into your R-project and project folder
at the same location.

Copy the files into \texttt{tutorial/input/t\_metmax/}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  PeakAreas.csv and
\item
  mz73.csv
\item
  MIDs.csv
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Copy files: \texttt{annotation.csv} and
\texttt{Sample\_extracts.csv}}{Copy files: annotation.csv and Sample\_extracts.csv}}\label{copy-files-annotation.csv-and-sample_extracts.csv-1}

Both files contain important information about your metabolomics
experiment and since these information are highly specific you need to
create them on your own and save them in \texttt{project-folder/input/}.

Browse to both files in the tutorial dataset, have a look at the content
and copy both files into \texttt{t\_metmax/input}.

\textbf{The annotation file}

The herein shown \emph{annotation file} contains information about the
eperimental conditions of each sample and measurement file. The columns
\textbf{File} and \textbf{Type} are mandatory and the minimum content of
an annotation file. Additional columns defining further conditions, like
cell line or glucose level, are totally customizable to your
preferences.

Though, I suggest to set up a maximum of four parameter. If your project
requires more try to create combinations. Later on this helps to
visualise your data using MTXQC\_part2. The number of parameters is
limited by the availabily of diagram axes, facets and paper size.
Subsequently written individual reports are independent of this and
conditions could be split and extended without any limitations.

\textbf{The sample extrats file}

The \emph{sample extracts} file specify the nature and volume / weight
of the sample extracts. The columns \textbf{Extract\_vol} and
\textbf{Unit} (count, mg or ul) are mandatory here.

The minimal file contains these two columns with at least one row /
entry, e.g. \(1.5e+6\) \& count. This would result into the association
of \(1.5e+6\) cells to each file.

This file here in this tutorial shows cell extracts defined with the
unit \emph{count} for specific conditions. Please be aware that names of
experimental conditions have to match between annotation and sample
extracts file.

Nevertheless it is not necessarily required to define for each
combination of conditions a cell count. Please refer FAQs section
\ref{createannotation} and \ref{createsampleextracts} for further
information how to create and set up both files from the scretch.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Update \texttt{Metabolite\_manual} in the
file
\texttt{config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolites.csv}}{Update Metabolite\_manual in the file config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolites.csv}}\label{update-metabolite_manual-in-the-file-config_mtxconversion_metabolites.csv}

In order to automatically process through MTXQCvX2 you need to link the
names of your intermediates given in ChromaToF with the corresponding
metabolites in \texttt{conversion\_metabolites.csv}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open the file \texttt{conversion\_metabolite.csv} and your peak area
  matrix file
\item
  Update the column `Metabolite\_manual' with the choosen names
\end{itemize}

I suggest to use always a similar format, e.g. \texttt{\#Alanine\_3TMS}.
In case of the presence of main- (MP) and byproducts (BP) use:
Metabolite\_Derivate\_MP/BP, e.g., Glucose\_(1MEOX)(5TMS)\_MP. In that
way names keep short, easy to remember and effeciently setup in all
other files like the metmax import list to extract the MIDs\footnote{Mass
  isotopomer distribution} for each intermediate.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Define the internal standard and alkanes in
\texttt{config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolites.csv}}{Define the internal standard and alkanes in config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolites.csv}}\label{define-the-internal-standard-and-alkanes-in-config_mtxconversion_metabolites.csv}

Both information are specified in the column \texttt{Standard} with
either \texttt{InternalStandard} or \texttt{Alk}, respectively.
Furhtermore, we need to define cinnamic acid as internal standard and
nine alkanes (c10-c36).

The in-lab protocol considers nine alkanes from c10 to c36. Standard
annotation includes an hashtag, e.g., \#c10. Small fun fact: if you use
this annotation even Metmax would be able to determine the retention
index.

To do so:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open the file: \texttt{config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolite.csv}
\item
  Scroll down to the entry \texttt{Cinnamic\ acid\ trans-,\ 1TMS}
\item
  Verify that \texttt{InternalStandard} is defined in the column
  \texttt{Standard}
\item
  Check the annotation of alkanes in \texttt{Metabolite\_manual}
\item
  Define all nine with adding \texttt{Alk} in the column
  \texttt{Standard}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process
\texttt{MTXQC\_ExperimentalSetup.csv}}{Process MTXQC\_ExperimentalSetup.csv}}\label{process-mtxqc_experimentalsetup.csv-1}

We are ready now to start processing the second module of the MTXQCvX2
called the Experimental Setup. In order to faciliate automated data
processing throughout MTXQC files and parameters have to be defined
beforehand for each project-folder.

Defined parameters are saved in the file \texttt{MTXQC\_params.csv}
inside the project-folder for future reference enabling to move the
project-folder independently of the remaining MTXQC-files. A huge
advantage for debugging and sharing your project\footnote{Just zip-file
  the project-folder and send it via mail.}

Define the following parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Define project-folder:} t\_metmax
\item
  \textbf{Define input-format:} metmax
\item
  **Name of annotation \url{file:**} annotation.csv
\item
  **Name of sample extracts \url{file:**} sample\_extracts.csv
\item
  \textbf{Type of experiment:} pSIRM
\item
  \textbf{Applied 13C-substrates:} glc
\item
  \textbf{Internal standard:} check
\item
  \textbf{Type of samples:} cell extracts
\item
  \textbf{Additional calibration curves:} no
\item
  \textbf{Integrate add. calibration curves:} no
\item
  \textbf{Quantification standards:} Quant1\_v4
\item
  \textbf{Volume polar phase of Quants:} 500
\item
  \textbf{Technical replicates:}\footnote{Also called backups} 2
\end{itemize}

Confirm the parameter and file definition and wait a moment. Check if
you can find the file \texttt{MTXQC\_params.csv}.

Have a look at the produced pdf-file and check the comments and
messages. Throughout MTXQCvX2 messages inform about: * Successfull data
imports * Fatal errors causing an automatic stop of data processing and
* Warnings pointing towards things that should be checked before moving
to the next step.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process
\texttt{MTXQC\_part4.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_part4.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_part4.rmd}

Now everything is prepared to transform our spreadsheet data into proper
MTXQCvX2 input files. Please go ahead and define the following parameter
to run \texttt{MTXQC\_part4.Rmd}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Project folder:} t\_metmax
\item
  \textbf{File containing peak areas:} PeakAreas.csv
\item
  \textbf{File containing mz 73 values:} mz73.csv
\item
  \textbf{File containing MIDs:} MIDs.csv
\item
  \textbf{Generate file for internal standard:} (check)
\item
  \textbf{Generate file for alkanes:} (check)
\item
  \textbf{Generate file for sum of area normalisation:} (check)
\item
  **Generate ManualQuantTable and samples \url{file:**} (check)
\item
  \textbf{Determine isotope incorporation:} (check)
\end{itemize}

After the successfull processing you should find the parameter file
\texttt{Metmax\_params.csv} inside your project folder, as well as all
files in their correct \texttt{input-folders}.

Have a look and check if you got all of them and have a look at the
messages in the \texttt{MTXQC\_part4.Rmd} report.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process
\texttt{MTXQC\_part1.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_part1.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_part1.rmd-1}

Since we have defined all required input parameter the main module is
ready to run after the definition of only three parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition of the project-folder:} t\_metmax
\item
  **Type of \url{data:**} metmax
\item
  **Manual validated \url{data:**} none
\end{itemize}

Also here, scroll carefully through the generated pdf-file and have a
look at the messages. If all works out it doesn't matter, but it might
help to know what should be written if you end up with an error message
instead of.

Each generated graphic is going to be explained in detail in chapter
\ref{part1}. For now please refer to my phd thesis \citep{Zasada2017}.

All quality metrices are visualised on the last page of the report split
into two heatmaps:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  GC-performance (orange): across all measurements
\item
  Quantification \& isotope incorporation (blue): for each intermediate
  individually, but across all exp. conditions
\end{itemize}

Besides the generation of the MTXQC\_part1 report several
\texttt{csv-files} are exported into the output folder summarising
statistics of all quality control metrices. The content of each file is
summarised in the dictionary of tables (chapter \ref{tables}).

The most important file \texttt{CalculationFileData.csv} summarises all
experimental conditions, normalisation factors as well as information
about calibration curve parameter and derived quantities. You find this
file here - \texttt{project-folder/output/quant/}.

It is worth to open this file in a program of your choice and check for
a selected intermediate the content. Wrong assignments of conditions in
the annotation or sample extracts-file might cause duplication of
values, easily to identify if exactly the same peak areas, so the same
file, appears multiple times.

\texttt{CalculationFileData.csv} is all about the absolute quantities
and data normalisation. Why does it not contain information about
isotope incorporation you might ask. Well, depending on the experimental
setup you might follow different ways how to combine both entities.
Furthermore \texttt{MTXQC\_part1.Rmd} is not about doing any processing
of the data in the sense of analysis or statistics\footnote{Quality
  metrices are a different pair of shoes here and are not data per se}.
It is supposed to assess the quality meaning the evaluation of the mass
isotopomer distributions (MIDs) that are the basis for the calculation
of the isotope incorporation.

The next module has been set up to give you a first quick report about
the content of your data performing basic post processing steps
inclduing the statistics part.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process
\texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_part2.rmd-1}

This module aims to provide you a quick overview of your data. It
generates, based on your parameter definition while processing this
file, statistics of quantities for each intermediate as well as isotope
incorporation and 13C-labeled quantities.

A senseful association of your experimental parameter might provide you
even ready-to-show plots for a presentation or report. Different color
schemes are in place to meet your personal taste - play a bit and find
your favorite ;).

All kind of outputs (graphics, statistics) are saved at
\texttt{output/quant/...} into a day-specific folder\footnote{Called:
  Date\_PostProcessing\_AnalysisParam\_QuantitativeValue}, meaning if
you repeat the same analysis several times a day the content is replaced
with each run\footnote{Same thing for the generated pdf-report so I
  recommend to move it into the post processing folder for future
  reference}. Simply modify the folder name to avoid this behaviour. If
you go on with your analysis the next or another day a new folder is
created.

Go and process this module with the following parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Project-folder:} t\_metmax
\item
  \textbf{Type of analysis:} less\_stringent
\item
  \textbf{Internal standard:} QC\footnote{meaning, that all the internal
    standard has to be within a defined range of variation, files with
    higher variation are excluded from the analysis}
\item
  \textbf{Quantitative value:} InstStd\_Conc\_pmio\footnote{Translated:
    Normalised (regarding the internal standard) quantities in
    (pmol/1e+6 cells)}
\item
  \textbf{par1:} Time
\item
  \textbf{par2:} CL
\item
  \textbf{par3:} none
\item
  \textbf{par4:} none
\item
  \textbf{updated:} none
\item
  \textbf{pre-defined color scheme:} choose yourself
\end{itemize}

Feel free to add further plots at the end of this report if required or
define your project specific color code at the beginning of the
document.

I recommend to use the output of \texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd} as a kind of
overall visualisation of the data. Specific questions might be addressed
in smaller reports using the output-files of \texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}.

I furthermore suggest to process both type of analysis - stringent and
less stringent - to get an impression at what points the manual
validation of distinct intermediates might be useful.

\section{At the end\ldots{}}\label{at-the-end-1}

So far you have used MTXQCvX2 to generate two reports: 1. one
summarising the quality of the generated data and 2. a first statistical
overview about the content of your data.

With this the tutorial ends and refers to the plenty of detailed
information scattered in a number of additional chapters of this
documentation. The FAQ section tries to guide you through more specific
settings and introduces you to the flexibility of MTXQCvX2.

Since every metabolomics experiment has it's own purpose and reasoning I
want to point out, that MTXQCvX2 does not want to provide a magical tool
giving the perfect solution for everyone. It rather tries to provide a
common platform for discussions, information exchange and inspiration by
reducing the time that has to be spend on ``the boring part of
research''. There is no limit to make MTXQC your own perfect tool
writing your own reports and extensions. Feel free and hoepfully
motivated to share your report as a template with your colleagues.

\chapter{Data Processing for Metmax}\label{metmaxproc}

The following steps are done in ChromaToF on the raw data exported from
the machine. I highly recommend to create a local copy of your data and
then import it into ChromaToF. ChromaToF is not the fastest software and
the server doesn't help for sure with that.

For each data processing (DP) method you need to define tasks by
checking boxes at the top of the window. With each ticked box the
related parameter that can be modified are listed below that list of
tasks. So always remeber to scroll down, and after setting parameters,
scroll up and check your ticks another time.

In general you first adjust the choice of DP method first and apply it
subsequently - choose one file, right click and choose \emph{Process
data}. Select all files and the DP method.

\section{Import data into ChromaToF}\label{import-data-into-chromatof}

Create a new project folder in the menu \texttt{Acquired\ Samples} and
rename it, e.g., with the date and project name. Click on the folder to
activate it.

Now you can move down a window, just right click somewhere in this
window and choose \emph{Import data}. Select your \texttt{.SMP} files
and wait until ChromaToF is done.

\section{DP - Resampling}\label{dp---resampling}

Resampling is commonly applied and results into a data transformation
enabling an improved detection of low abundant peaks and a reduction of
noise. (Maybe include an example?)

The processing methods requires to tick the task
\texttt{Export\ data\ file}. Subsequently, you are asked to define an
output folder and the following paramter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reduction rate: 4
\item
  From the beginning to end of the file
\item
  \texttt{.peg}-files
\end{itemize}

In the next step the generated files have to be re-imported into a
subfolder in \texttt{Acquired\ Samples} in ChromaToF.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create subfolder called \texttt{resample} in ChromaToF
\item
  Right-click file window below
\item
  Import \texttt{.peg}-files
\end{itemize}

\section{DP - 1D-basic}\label{dp---1d-basic}

Please check the following task in ChromaToF
\texttt{Data\ Processing\ (DP)\ Methods}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Baseline
\item
  Peak Find
\item
  Library Search
\item
  Calculate Area / Height
\item
  Retention Index Method
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Baseline}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  enter baseline tracking from \texttt{start\ of\ the\ run} until
  \texttt{end\ of\ run}
\item
  baseline offset 1
\item
  number of data points for smoothing: auto
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Peak Find}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  peak width: 4
\item
  maximum number of unknown peaks to find: 600
\item
  S/N: 50.0
\item
  library identity: normal
\item
  library search mode: forward
\item
  number of library hits returned: 10
\item
  min. molecular weigth allowed: 0
\item
  max. molecular weight allowed: 1500
\item
  mass threshold: 0
\item
  min. similarity match: 0
\item
  Add libraries: gmd-merged-kempa
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calculate Area / Height}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  enter mass to use: U
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Retention Index Method}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  choose your retention index method
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Create the Retention Index Method}\label{createri}

Before proceeding with applying processing method you need to prepare
the Retention Index Method.

Create a new Retention Index Method:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Scroll down in the main menu and click on Retention Index Methods
\item
  Right click on the white in the window below
\item
  Select new
\item
  Rename it
\end{itemize}

This creates an empty table in the main window. Use the blue plus sign
and add nine rows. If you cannot click on the plus, make sure you
clicked the name of the retention indey method before.

Adjust the entries the following way:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Change names from 1..9: \#c10, \#c12, \#c15, \#c17, \#c19, \#c22,
  \#c28, \#c32, \#c36
\item
  Retention Index is equal to the product of number of carbons and 100
  (RI of \#c10 is 1000)
\item
  Verification Mass: 85
\end{itemize}

Go back to your measurements and select a wash run. Select the alkane
masses, normally saved in shortcut B, and collect the retention times.
Add these values in the retention index method. All done, select the
retention index method in data processing methods.

Run the processing method \texttt{1D-basic} over all your files.

\section{Reference search}\label{reference-search}

\subsection{Create a reference in
ChromaToF}\label{create-a-reference-in-chromatof}

\subsection{Process your reference
search}\label{process-your-reference-search}

Check the task and following parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Apply Reference(s):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    S/N: 10 - 50
  \item
    Mass Threshold: 0
  \item
    Add the references
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Very important} Always scroll up and check the ticked tasks
again. \textbf{Always\ldots{} and really always} when you change the
reference ChromaToF checks the PeakFind option for you. But this we
definitely do not want since the basic processing just pre-annotated all
peaks that were detected and identifiable. If you forget to uncheck the
box only the compounds listed in your reference are annotated, all other
annotations are replaced with unknown and a number.

\section{Export for Metmax}\label{export-for-metmax}

Check tasks in `data processing methods:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\section{Data extraction with Metmax}\label{metmax-dataextr}

\subsection[Quantification -
PeakAreas.csv]{\texorpdfstring{Quantification - PeakAreas.csv\footnote{Required
  for: all parameter, just not
  \texttt{calculation\ stable\ isotope\ incorporation}}}{Quantification - PeakAreas.csv}}\label{quantification---peakareas.csv}

In order to perform absolute quantification you need a file containing
all extracted peak areas for each metabolite and file\footnote{Tools/Options/Retention
  analysis, Parameter: Area}.

The header of metmax-extracted files looks like shown below (see table
1). Please, remember to delete the second header row, representing the
column loads for each file before saving as csv-file. Otherwise you end
up with weird imported dataframes in R.

Quantification masses have to be updated while processing in ChromaToF
prior the export of the data e.g., with a reference search (see section
\ref{refsearch}{]} or using statistical compare. pSIRM experiments
require the definition of pTop5 masses; an extended list of quant masses
considering isotope incorporation instead of top5 masses in the
reference in order to take into account the shift of intensities induced
by the application of stable isotopes\footnote{Mandatory columns: name,
  mass, files} (see \emph{somewhere}).

MTXQC\_part4 takes care of the formatting and correct column names of
the peak areas file and saves it in
\texttt{input/quant/quantMassAreasMatrix.csv}.\\
MTXQC\_part4 generates also the file PeakDensities-Chroma.csv and saves
it in \texttt{input/gc/PeakDensities-Chroma.csv} in case you have
selected the option to include sum of area normalisation while knitting
this module.

\subsection[Isotope incorporation - MIDs.csv]{\texorpdfstring{Isotope
incorporation - MIDs.csv\footnote{Required for
  \texttt{calculation\ isotope\ incorporation}}}{Isotope incorporation - MIDs.csv}}\label{isotope-incorporation---mids.csv}

In order to determine the incorporation of stable isotopes MTXQCvX2
requires as an input the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) for each
intermediate and measurement\footnote{Metmax: Tools/Options/Isotope
  concentrator; Parameter: IntensityOfMass}. Fragments for each
intermediate have to be pre-defined in metmax in the menue
Tools/Options/metabolite masses.

You can import a prepared list (have a look at
\texttt{inst/template\_files/MetMax\_MIDs.txt}) or specify each entry
manually. An example of the metmax output is shown in table 2. The
output has to be saved as csv-file, including the deletion of the
partial row \texttt{column.load}, respectively\footnote{Mandatory
  columns: name, mass, files}.

\rowcolors{2}{gray!6}{white}

MTXQC\_part4 calculates the stable isotope incorporation and exports
DataMatrix.csv as well as pSIRM\_SpectraData.csv saved in
\texttt{input/inc/DataMatrix} \& \texttt{pSIRM\_SpectraData.csv},
respectively. The mathematics behind are outlined in \citep{Pietzke2014}

\textbf{Important:} Extracted MIDs have to match with defined mass
couples for each metabolite in MTXQCvX2 defined in
\texttt{config\_mtx/incorpo\_calc\_masses.csv}. Please refer for more
details in chapter \ref{config}.

\subsection[Derivatisation efficiency -
mz73.csv]{\texorpdfstring{Derivatisation efficiency - mz73.csv\footnote{Required
  for: \texttt{sum\ of\ area\ normalisation}}}{Derivatisation efficiency - mz73.csv}}\label{derivatisation-efficiency---mz73.csv}

The extraction of intensities for the ion \(m/z 73\) works analogous to
the extraction of MIDs\footnote{Tools/Options/Isotope concentrator;
  Parameter: IntensityOfMass}.

Mass ranges have to be defined for each intermediate for the mass 73 by
defining starting and end mass with 73. MTXQC\_part4 generates the file
and saves it in \texttt{input/gc/MassSum-73.csv}. Check
\texttt{inst\textbackslash{}template\_files\textbackslash{}} for
reference. Hopefully soon a new metmax button extracting specific
intensities across the batch.

\chapter{Frequently Asked Questions}\label{FAQ}

Please keep in mind that thorughout this section the project-folder is
referred as `psirm\_glucose'.

If you do not find an answer to your question - please create an issue
directly in the github repository\footnote{check
  \url{https://www.github.com/ChrisZasa/MTXQC_documentation/}} or write
an e-mail.

\section{How do I create my annotation-file?}\label{createannotation}

The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or
specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns -
\textbf{File and Type} - are obligatory and have to be present in the
annotation file. In the case of their absence
\texttt{MTXQCvX\_part1.Rmd} stops processing and shows an error message.

A quick way to generate an annotation file is described below:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Copy the first row / header of \texttt{quantMassAreaMatrix.csv} file
\item
  Paste \& transpose the content into a new Excel-File into column A
\item
  Change the first entry: Metabolite -\textgreater{} File
\item
  Remove the entry QuantMasses at the very end of the column A
\item
  Add the column Type and specify each file either as \textbf{sample},
  \textbf{Q1\_dilution} or \textbf{addQ1\_dilution}\footnote{see for
    further details additionalQuant}
\item
  Add more columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g.,
  Cellline and Treatment\footnote{optimal: two to three parameter, at
    maimumx: four parameter. Consider combinations of parameter, e.g.,
    HCT116-control, HCT116-BPTES}
\item
  Save the content as \texttt{csv-file} in, e.g.,
  \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input/...}
\end{enumerate}

\section{\texorpdfstring{How do I create the file
\texttt{sample\_extracts.csv}?}{How do I create the file sample\_extracts.csv?}}\label{createsampleextracts}

The \texttt{sample\_extracts.csv} file is required in order to determine
automatically absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or
pmol/mg tissue in the \texttt{CalculationFileData.csv}.

This file requires two obligatory columns - \textbf{Extract\_vol} and
\textbf{Unit}\footnote{Define: count, mg or ul}. Please specify for each
experimental condition the amount of extracted cells (count), tissue
(mg) or volume of blood/plasme (ul) in the unit shown in the brackets.\\
The names of the columns of the experimental conditions have to match up
with the annotation file. Save the file in the folder
\texttt{psirm\_glucose/input/...}.

If the defined experimental conditions do not match up with the
annotation \texttt{MTXQC\_part1.Rmd} exit data processing. A template
file is saved for review and usage at \texttt{inst/template\_files/...}

\section{How do I define an internal extraction standard other than
cinnamic acid?}\label{definternal}

MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal
extraction standards. The only thing you need to do is to define the
corresponding compounds as an internal standard in the
\texttt{config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolite.csv} file. To do so, add to
the compound in last column \texttt{Standard} the entry
\texttt{InternalStandard}.

The definition of an internal standard requires the file
`InternalStandard.csv' in the folder \texttt{input/gc} since it is used
for the evaluation of normalisation factors in MTXQC\_part1.

\textbf{Scenario 1} Maui-project and Cinnamic acid

For an classical pSIRM experiment in the Kempa lab we are using cinnamic
acid. The evaluation of this compound has been integrated into Maui.
Peak areas of cinnamic acid are exported from the container called
\texttt{cinAcid}. The exported file\footnote{see section
  \ref{mauiexports}} has to be renamed to \texttt{InternalStandard.csv}
though and moved to \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input/gc/...}.

\textbf{Scenario 2} Maui-project and different internal standard

If you have used a different compound as an internal extraction standard
you might need to extract the peak areas of this compound from the file
\texttt{quantPeakAreasMatrix.csv} and save it in the folder
\texttt{psirm\_glucose/input/gc/InternalStandard.csv}, respectively.
Prerequisite here - you have annotated the compound in your
Maui-project.

\textbf{Scenario 3} Metmax-project

In the case you used metmax the module \texttt{MTXQC\_part4.Rmd} takes
care for you of the generation of the \texttt{InternalStandard.csv}
based on the definition in \texttt{conversion\_metabolite.csv} and
provided peak areas\footnote{see chapter \ref{Metmax}}. This procedure
is independent what standard you have defined. It only requires the
annotation of your compound in chromtof and successful export with
metmax.

\section{How do I combine multiple MAUI-projects into a single
MTXQC-project?}\label{multipleproj}

Certain circumstances might wish you to combine \emph{multiple
MAUI-projects} into one MTXQC-project. This might be the case when you
run the same samples in split and splitless mode on the machine or your
experimental setup has been measured in multiple batches in order to
avoid derivatisation effects.

It is highly recommended to combine the input files derived from a
different Maui projects beforehand the analysis. In that way you have
only to work with a single file
\texttt{CalculationFileData.csv}\footnote{stored in
  \texttt{psirm\_glucose/output/quant/...}} containing all data of the
your experiment.

The herein described process provides a quick way how to combine the
exported files from different Maui projects. The script
\texttt{combine-sets.R}\footnote{inst/template\_files/\ldots{}}
automatically saves all combined files into the correct \texttt{input}
folder. Just update the folder and subfolder names. All the rest has
been taken care of for you.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create in the MTXQC-project folder (e.g., \texttt{psirm\_glucose/}) a
  new folder called \texttt{raw-data}
\item
  Create a subfolder for each Maui-project in
  \texttt{psirm\_glucose/raw\_data/...}
\item
  Copy into this folder all your Maui-derived input files altogether
\item
  Update the parameter of \texttt{combine-sets.R}, meaning folder name
  definitions, file
\item
  Execute the R script
\item
  Merged files have been generated and copied into the corresponding
  folder: \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input-folder/gc/...} or
  \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input-folder/inc/...}
\item
  Copy the renamed \texttt{ManualQuantTable.tsv} files of each Maui
  project into \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input/quant/...}
\end{enumerate}

\section{How do I extend conversion\_metabolite.csv}\label{extendconse}

At a certain point you might want to add a compound or derivate that is
not part of the current setup of metabolites. For simplicity we assume
you want to add an intermediate for quantitative and isotope
incorporation\footnote{Just skip this if this is not required}.

In order to include this new compound you need to add information to the
following files in \texttt{config\_mtx}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{conversion\_metabolite.csv}
\item
  \texttt{letter\_pathway\_complete.csv}
\item
  \texttt{incorp\_calc\_masses.csv}
\item
  \texttt{mid\_backups.csv}
\end{itemize}

If you desire the absolute quantification of this new compound you most
probably need to either: (1) include the compound in quant-standards or
(2) measure additional quantification standards. Please read sections
\ref{quantquant}, @ref(\#quantind) and \ref{addqadds} how to proceed.

\textbf{\texttt{conversion\_metabolite.csv}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Define the three variations - Metabolite, Metaboite\_short, Lettercode
  - of the compound name by analogy with the present list (text)
\item
  Q1\_value: check only if this compound is part of a quantification mix
  (x)
\item
  Mass\_Pos: define the m/z-value reflecting the shift of intensity in
  case of the incorporation of stable isotopes (numeric)
\item
  SE\_sel: check only if MID exports are available (x)
\item
  Q\_sel:
\item
  nopsirm: check if this compound should not considered for isotope inc.
  (x)
\item
  Standards: define as \emph{InternalStandard} if applicable
\end{itemize}

** \texttt{letter\_pathway\_complete.csv}

** \texttt{ìncorp\_calc\_masses.csv}

Define the couple of m/z-values for your compound: - m0 - mono-isotopic
mass/charge value and - minc - mass/charge value reflecting shift of
intensities

In case you want to define more than one pair of m/z-values have a look
at the defined TCA-cycle intermediates.

\chapter{Appendix - pSIRM experiments}\label{psirm}

The application of stable isotopes provides a powerful tool to track the
activity of metabolic pathways. the time-dependent and atom-specific
routing along a metabolic pathway resolved how substrates like glucose
or glutamine are used in order to maintain a certain phenotype and
energetic homeostatsis.

We developed an approach called pulsed stable isotope resolved
metabolomics (pSIRM) enabling the quantitative evaluation of metabolite
pool sizes and incorporation of stable isotopes, e.g.,
\(^{13}C_6\)-glucose. A thoughtful setup of the experimental design
including the applied substrates and carefull experimental handling are
prerequisites for a successful pSIRM experiment. Essential aspects are
collected in the below paragraphs along with a number of usefull tweaks.

\section{Experimental design}\label{experimental-design}

An \emph{in vitro} pSIRM experiment lasts in total up to three days
starting from the cell seeding at day zero. Further along the way up to
two media changes should be included until the application of stable
isotopes and harvesting the cells maintaining the continouse
availability of nutrients and avoiding the accumulation of waste
products (Figure \ref(fig:psirm)). The media change four hours prior the
harvest is set up in order to give cells time to recover from the
mechanical stress of the media change. At the time point of harvest
cells should be in a perfect happily state regarding metabolic
environment and stress.

Choose carefully the \emph{seeding density of you cells} in the first
place. High confluency inducing contact inhibition of cell growth has a
strong impact on several cellular processes including the uptake of
nutrients. Try to aim for petri dishes with a maximum confluency of
75-80 \%. A pre-experiment including different cell densities for
seeding at a number of experimental conditions helps you to get a
feeling for the cell growth in general and an expected output of cells
at the time point of the harvest. Later one is useful to plan sample
extraction and measurement subsequently.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=13.14in]{images/psirm_harvest} \caption{Experimental design of a pSIRM experiment distuingishing short and long labeling with stable isotopes.}\label{fig:psirmexp}
\end{figure}

For adherent cell cultures only: Include for each experimental condition
an additional petri dish that is solely used to determine the cell count
at the time point of your harvest. This additional plate ensures a
correct determination of absolute quantities and might reduce variation
of pool sizes in the statistical analysis\footnote{Pelleting these cells
  and snap-freezing might give usefull additional samples for western
  blotting.}. Think carefully about control conditions and include cell
culture dishes that are not labeled. These dishes function as a control
for your labeling procedure and the natural abundance of isotopes.

\section{Experimental procedures}\label{experimental-procedures}

There is a slight difference in the protocols for
\protect\hyperlink{psirm:adherent}{adherent} and
\protect\hyperlink{psirm:suspension}{suspension} cells. Please read
instructions and footnotes carefully.

Short\footnote{I would rather recommend this up to 2 min of labeling}
and long term labeling procured differ only in the applied solvents
during the labeling - either label buffer
(\protect\hyperlink{washingbuffer}{LB}) only or a combination of full
label medium (LM) and label buffer (LB). Latter one is applied in order
to remove extracellular metabolites of the media. Both label buffer and
media contain the major nutrients / stable isotopes to keep the main
substrates at constant supply at all times (Table \ref{tab:solvent}).
During the application of stable isotopes longer than a few minutes
cells might sense the absence of further intermediates provided during
standard cell culture procedure and and adjust their metabolic program
accordingly.

\begin{table}[t]

\caption{\label{tab:solvent}Solvent composition of Full label medium (LM) and label buffer (BF) for a pSIRM experiment labeling with 13C-glucose.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
Solvent & Base & Carbon.source & Supplements\\
\midrule
Full label medium (LM) & DMEM, without glucose, glutamine, pyruvate & 13C-Glc (2.5 g/L)
12C-Gln (2 mM) & small molecules 
(inhibitor, antibiotics)\\
Label buffer (LB) & HEPES (5 mM), NaCl (140 mM), pH 7.4 & 13C-Glc (2.5 g/L)
12C-Gln (2 mM) & \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The quality of your data later heavily relies on the exact handling of
the cells and a \emph{consistent timing} throughout the pSIRM
experiment. Especially the step removing the LB and quenching the cells
should be a matter of a tenth of seconds rather than seconds. It is of
great value to perform the cell harvest with a second person.

\section{Protocol pSIRM}\label{protocol-psirm}

\hypertarget{psirm:adherent}{\subsection{Adherent cell
cultures}\label{psirm:adherent}}

The herein described protocols are detailed explanations how to perform
a pSIRM cell harvest for long term label application. If you want to
label for less than 2 minutes omit solely \emph{omit steps 6-8}.

Materials:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cell culture dishes, max. confluency 80 \%
\item
  Labeling media (LM) supplemented with substrates (5 ml /
  dish)\footnote{Not required for short term labeling}
\item
  Label buffer (LB) supplemented with substrates (5 ml / dish)
\item
  Ice-cold 50 \% MeOH supplemented with 2 ug/ul cinnamic acid
\item
  2x 5 ml pipette and tips\footnote{Highly recommended, makes labeling
    and harvest super quick}
\item
  Beaker
\item
  Ice
\item
  15 ml falcons (chloroform resistant)
\item
  Cell lifter
\item
  Biological waste bin next to your bench
\end{itemize}

Procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Pre-warm LB and LM in the water bath
\item
  Take a number of petri dishes (condition-wise including all biol.
  replicates)
\item
  Discard cell culture media
\item
  Carefully add \emph{long term labeling} LM OR \emph{short term
  labeling}: LB
\item
  Incubate cells on the bench or in an incubator
\item
  Discard LM (beaker)
\item
  Add immediatly 5 ml of LB
\item
  Rotate dish once in order to cover complete surface
\item
  Meanwhile 2nd person get prepared with 5 ml ice-cold MeOH
\item
  Discard LB into beaker and \emph{immediatly} 2nd person quenches with
  ice-cold MeOH
\item
  Collect cell extracts using cell lifter
\item
  Transfer cell extracts into 15 ml falcons
\item
  Store falcons on ice until further processing
\end{enumerate}

Repeat this procedure (step 6-10) for all dishes of a single condition
first. Once MeOH is added metabolic processes are interrupted and cell
extracts can be collected with the help of cell lifter without rush and
subsequently transfered to 15 ml falcon and stored on ice until further
processing (see chapter \protect\hyperlink{ccextraction_meoh}{Cell
extraction methanolic extracts}).

Determine the cell count using your additional petri dishes for each
condition.

\hypertarget{psirm:suspension}{\subsection{Supension cell
cultures}\label{psirm:suspension}}

Materials:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cell culture flasks
\item
  Labeling media (LM) supplemented with substrates
\item
  5 ml pipette and tips\footnote{Highly recommended, makes labeling and
    harvest super quick}
\item
  1 ml pipette
\item
  Beaker
\item
  paper tissues
\item
  Liquid nitrogen
\item
  15 ml falcons
\item
  1.5 ml eppendorf tubes
\item
  Biological waste bin next to your bench
\end{itemize}

Procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Pre-warm LM in the water bath
\item
  Determine the cell count of your cell suspension(s)
\item
  Take aliquots of \(10-15e+6\) cells and transfer into 15 ml falcon
\item
  Spin down cells very gently 300 g, 2 min at room temperature
\item
  Discard media into beaker
\item
  Resuspend cells gently in three-times 1 ml\footnote{To generate three
    replicates}
\item
  Incubate and keep warm
\item
  Fractionate cell supension in three eppendorf tubes (3x 1 ml each)
\item
  Spin down quickly in top-bench centrifuge\footnote{Most of the times
    30 s are already enough}
\item
  Discard media blandtly on paper tissues
\item
  Snap-freeze immediatly in liquid nitrogen
\item
  Store cells until further processing (see chapter
  \protect\hyperlink{ccextraction_susp}{Cell extraction suspension
  cells})
\end{enumerate}

The important step here to be quick is the alquotation of the cell
suspension and subsequent spin down in the table centrifuge. Suspension
cells are rather small, nevertheless \(3e+6\) cells per extract are a
good starting point for GC-MS measurements.

\section{Hints \& notes}\label{hints-notes}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The only way to be reproducible and fast is to team up with a second
  person.
\item
  Keep timing consistently through the experiment.
\item
  Keep substrate concentrations constant throughout the experiment in
  all solutions.
\item
  Supplement one stable isotopic labeled substrate with all remaining
  substrates in non-labeled form.
\item
  Think about nutrient levels in your cell culture and your experimental
  conditions. Maybe you want to change things to physiological levels.
\item
  Add additional plate to each condition in order to have material for
  western blotting and others.
\item
  Check carefully the confluency of your dishes and determine seeding
  densities for different conditions.
\item
  In case of small molecule inhibitors: Try to avoid to solve them in
  DMSO - strong impact on chromatography.
\end{itemize}
