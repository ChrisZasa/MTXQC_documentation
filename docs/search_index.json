The underling experimental and mathematical concepts have been introduced for the pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM) approach published in (Pietzke et al. 2014). This documentation shows you how to use MTXQCvX2 in order to assess the quality of your GC-MS derived data, perform the determination of calibration curves and absolute quantification. It furthermore provides you two normalisation strategies and the calculation of quantities in, e.g., pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue. MTXQCvX2 does also enable the calculation of stable isotopic incorporation and the evaluation of the underlying data, the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs). The tool has been set up to support the in-lab developed workflow for quantitative metabolomics experiments using the in-house developed software Maui for the annotation of data. MTXQCvX2 bridges the gap between quality control and first data post-processing / analysis of GC-MS derived data (MTXQCvX2_part1, MTXQCvX2_part2). Nevertheless MTXQCvX2 includes a module in order to integrate all kind of data provided in spreadsheet-format, e.g., derived from metmax, extracting required information and creating corresponding files (MTXQCvX2_part4). 2.1 Structure MTXQCvX2 contains a suite of modules is optimized to process GC-MS derived data and processed either in Maui or Chromatof/Metmax. Workflows for both approaches are introduced with step-by-step tutorials in chapter 3 and 4. Subsequently each MTXQCvX2 module is introduced in greater detail including the list of processing parameter (chapter 6 - 10). The configuration of MTXQCvX2 has been split into two categories - (1) a general configuration config_files and (2) metabolomics specific parameters config_mtx. Latter one is meant to provide flexibility to adapt MTXQCvX2 to your needs. How to do so and what files can be customizes is shown in chapter 11. Workflow-specific processing methods applied in Chromatof are introduced separately in the chapter 12 and 13 including all parameter as well as a short introduction. The remaining chapter cover a chapter for frequently asked questions (chapter14) that might give you a hint where to search for the information you are looking for. The appendix summarises technical reference material in the form of a dictionary of tables (chapter 15), protocols for the pSIRM workflow 18 and a complete distinct chapter listing protocols (chapter 17) including standard and sample preparation and derivatisation (chapter 17.4 and 17.5) and the current setting of the GC-ToF-MS machine (chapter 17.6). 2.2 How to use this documentation This documentation provides for each level the right starting point. Complete newbies are highly suggested to start with one of the two tutorials and following the step-by-step descriptions using the example datasets. Also if you are using for the first time please go through to the chapter once to be aware of all the steps that are required to succeed. Experienced users might be referred to the explanation of the individual modules or to the how-to-guides for data processing and the FAQs section. 2.3 Example datasets and files introduce inst/template folder 2.4 What do I do if I don't find the answer?

Think about it as a big bubble containing and carrying all your data and analysis savely from one place to the other undisturbed of the outside changes. Open R-studio and create a new project following: File -&gt; New project -&gt; New Project -&gt; New Directory and call the directory tutorial_single_maui and the preferred subdirectory. I recommend to start each project in a new session (tick the box at the bottom of the dialogue box). 3.4.2 Copy MTXQCvX2 template files Download the current version of MTXQCvX2 called fluffy adventure1 Open and extract the zip-folder Copy all folders and files into your R-project ’tutorial_single_maui` 3.4.3 Process MTXQC_init.Rmd The module MTXQC_init.Rmd performs two important steps: 1. Check-up package installation 2. Creation of project-folder The project folder is supposed to provide a tidy structure while data processing and analysis and contains several pre-defined folder. Besides the following folders: ‘input’, ‘output’ and ‘figures’ you see a detailed subfolder structure. You find more details about each folder and additional suggestion how to use project-folder in chapter 5. All you need to do is to process the MTXQC_init.Rmd. The following procedure is how you process all .Rmd-files of MTXQCvX2: Click on the small black triangle next to the ball of yarn in the R-Studio toolbar Choose Knit with Parameters... If the .Rmd-file contains defined parameters a shiny dialogue pops up and provides an interactive selection based on the document. In the case of MTXQC_init.Rmd you are asked to define a so-called project-folder, e.g., psirm_glucose. Define the name of the project-folder: psirm_glucose Check in the files tab of R-Studio, browse through it and get familiar with the structure. This is the home of your metabolomics projects data analysis. 3.4.4 Prepare and copy input files Several files have to be exported from Maui and copied into the folders input/gc, input/quant and input/inc for the evaluation of the GC-MS performance, absolute quantification and isotope incorporation. Please follow the detailed instructions in section 12.3 if you need further information how to perform the export in Maui. For the purpose of the tutorial the exported files are already processed and provided in tutorial dataset input-folder. Select each file and copy it to the correct location inside your R-project. 3.4.5 Copy files: annotation.csv and Sample_extracts.csv Both files contain important information about your metabolomics experiment and since these information are highly specific you need to create them on your own and save them in project-folder/input/. Browse to both files in the tutorial dataset, have a look at the content and copy both files into psirm_glucose/input. The annotation file The herein shown annotation file contains information about the eperimental conditions of each sample and measurement file. The columns File and Type are mandatory and the minimum content of an annotation file. Additional columns defining further conditions, like cell line or glucose level, are totally customizable to your preferences. Though, I suggest to set up a maximum of four parameter. If your project requires more try to create combinations. Later on this helps to visualise your data using MTXQC_part2. The number of parameters is limited by the availabily of diagram axes, facets and paper size. Subsequently written individual reports are independent of this and conditions could be split and extended without any limitations. The sample extrats file The sample extracts file specify the nature and volume / weight of the sample extracts. The columns Extract_vol and Unit (count, mg or ul) are mandatory here. The minimal file contains these two columns with at least one row / entry, e.g. \\(1.5e+6\\) &amp; count. This would result into the association of \\(1.5e+6\\) cells to each file. This file here in this tutorial shows cell extracts defined with the unit count for specific conditions. Please be aware that names of experimental conditions have to match between annotation and sample extracts file. Nevertheless it is not necessarily required to define for each combination of conditions a cell count. Please refer FAQs section 14.1 and 14.2 for further information how to create and set up both files from the scretch. 3.4.6 Define an internal standard - cinnamic acid The tutorials dataset contains data derived from a classical pSIRM experiment. This includes that the experimentalist supplemented the extraction solvent with an internal extraction standard - cinnamic acid. All that we have to do is to check if this compound has been defined as InternalStandard in the file config_mtx/conversion_metabolite.csv. To do so: Open the file: ’config_mtx/conversion_metabolite.csv` Scroll down to the entry Cinnamic acid trans-, 1TMS Verify that InternalStandard is defined in the column Standard Save the file and close it Read the section ?? how to proceed in case you want to define a different compound as internal standard. 3.4.7 Process MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.csv We are ready now to start processing the second module of the MTXQCvX2 called the Experimental Setup. In order to faciliate automated data processing throughout MTXQC files and parameters have to be defined beforehand for each project-folder. Defined parameters are saved in the file MTXQC_params.csv inside the project-folder for future reference enabling to move the project-folder independently of the remaining MTXQC-files. A huge advantage for debugging and sharing your project2 Define the following parameter: Define project-folder: psirm_glucose Define input-format: maui Name of annotation file: annotation.csv Name of sample extracts file: sample_extracts.csv Type of experiment: pSIRM Applied 13C-substrates: glc Internal standard: check Type of samples: cell extracts Additional calibration curves: no Integrate add. calibration curves: no Quantification standards: Quant1_v3 Volume polar phase of Quants: 500 Technical replicates:3 no Confirm the parameter and file definition and wait a moment. Check if you can find the file MTXQC_params.csv and also Maui_params.csv. Latter one is automatically generated by selecting maui project as input format. Maui_params.csv contains the information of the pre-defined file names containing all required input data. Have a look at the produced pdf-file and check the comments and messages. Throughout MTXQCvX2 messages inform about: * Successfull data imports * Fatal errors causing an automatic stop of data processing and * Warnings pointing towards things that should be checked before moving to the next step. 3.4.8 Process MTXQC_part1.Rmd Since we have defined all required input parameter the main module is ready to run after the definition of only three parameter: Definition of the project-folder: psirm_glucose Type of data: maui Manual validated data: none Also here, scroll carefully through the generated pdf-file and have a look at the messages. If all works out it doesn’t matter, but it might help to know what should be written if you end up with an error message instead of. Each generated graphic is going to be explained in detail in chapter 7. For now please refer to my phd thesis (Zasada 2017). All quality metrices are visualised on the last page of the report split into two heatmaps: GC-performance (orange): across all measurements Quantification &amp; isotope incorporation (blue): for each intermediate individually, but across all exp. conditions Besides the generation of the MTXQC_part1 report several csv-files are exported into the output folder summarising statistics of all quality control metrices. The content of each file is summarised in the dictionary of tables (chapter 15). The most important file CalculationFileData.csv summarises all experimental conditions, normalisation factors as well as information about calibration curve parameter and derived quantities. You find this file here - project-folder/output/quant/. It is worth to open this file in a program of your choice and check for a selected intermediate the content. Wrong assignments of conditions in the annotation or sample extracts-file might cause duplication of values, easily to identify if exactly the same peak areas, so the same file, appears multiple times. CalculationFileData.csv is all about the absolute quantities and data normalisation. Why does it not contain information about isotope incorporation you might ask. Well, depending on the experimental setup you might follow different ways how to combine both entities. Furthermore MTXQC_part1 is not about doing any processing of the data in the sense of analysis or statistics4. It is supposed to assess the quality meaning the evaluation of the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) that are the basis for the calculation of the isotope incorporation. The next module has been set up to give you a first quick report about the content of your data performing basic post processing steps inclduing the statistics part. 3.4.9 Process MTXQC_part2.Rmd This module aims to provide you a quick overview of your data. It generates, based on your parameter definition while processing this file, statistics of quantities for each intermediate as well as isotope incorporation and 13C-labeled quantities. A senseful association of your experimental parameter might provide you even ready-to-show plots for a presentation or report. Different color schemes are in place to meet your personal taste - play a bit and find your favorite ;). All kind of outputs (graphics, statistics) are saved at output/quant/... into a day-specific folder5, meaning if you repeat the same analysis several times a day the content is replaced with each run6. Simply modify the folder name to avoid this behaviour. If you go on with your analysis the next or another day a new folder is created. Go and process this module with the following parameter: Project-folder: psirm_glucose Type of analysis: stringent Internal standard: QC7 Quantitative value: InstStd_Conc_pmio8 par1: time par2: substrate par3: whatelse par4: none updated: none pre-defined color scheme: choose yourself Feel free to add further plots at the end of this report if required or define your project specific color code at the beginning of the document. I recommend to use the output of MTXQC_part2.Rmd as a kind of overall visualisation of the data. Specific questions might be addressed in smaller reports using the output-files of MTXQC_part2.Rmd. I furthermore suggest to process both type of analysis - stringent and less stringent - to get an impression at what points the manual validation of distinct intermediates might be useful. 3.5 At the end… So far you have used MTXQCvX2 to generate two reports: 1. one summarising the quality of the generated data and 2. a first statistical overview about the content of your data. With this the tutorial ends and refers to the plenty of detailed information scattered in a number of additional chapters of this documentation. The FAQ section tries to guide you through more specific settings and introduces you to the flexibility of MTXQCvX2. Since every metabolomics experiment has it’s own purpose and reasoning I want to point out, that MTXQCvX2 does not want to provide a magical tool giving the perfect solution for everyone. It rather tries to provide a common platform for discussions, information exchange and inspiration by reducing the time that has to be spend on “the boring part of research”. There is no limit to make MTXQC your own perfect tool writing your own reports and extensions. Feel free and hoepfully motivated to share your report as a template with your colleagues.

This is the home of your metabolomics projects data analysis. 4.4.4 Copy input files fom tutorial dataset MTXQC_part4.Rmd convienently transform spreadsheet kind of data extracted with Metmax into suitable input files in the style of Maui input files. You do not need necessarily provide all three kind of information (peak areas, MIDs and m/z 73 values). It depends on the scope and setup of your metabolomics experiment. If you need detailed instructions how to use metmax have a look at the section 13. The input files of the tutorial dataset have to be copied from `input/metmax/’ into your R-project and project folder at the same location. Copy the files into tutorial/input/t_metmax/: PeakAreas.csv and mz73.csv MIDs.csv 4.4.5 Copy files: annotation.csv and Sample_extracts.csv Both files contain important information about your metabolomics experiment and since these information are highly specific you need to create them on your own and save them in project-folder/input/.

Nevertheless it is not necessarily required to define for each combination of conditions a cell count. Please refer FAQs section 14.1 and 14.2 for further information how to create and set up both files from the scretch. 4.4.6 Update Metabolite_manual in the file config_mtx/conversion_metabolites.csv In order to automatically process through MTXQCvX2 you need to link the names of your intermediates given in ChromaToF with the corresponding metabolites in conversion_metabolites.csv Open the file conversion_metabolite.csv and your peak area matrix file Update the column ‘Metabolite_manual’ with the choosen names I suggest to use always a similar format, e.g. #Alanine_3TMS. In case of the presence of main- (MP) and byproducts (BP) use: Metabolite_Derivate_MP/BP, e.g., Glucose_(1MEOX)(5TMS)_MP. In that way names keep short, easy to remember and effeciently setup in all other files like the metmax import list to extract the MIDs11 for each intermediate. 4.4.7 Define the internal standard and alkanes in config_mtx/conversion_metabolites.csv Both information are specified in the column Standard with either InternalStandard or Alk, respectively. Furhtermore, we need to define cinnamic acid as internal standard and nine alkanes (c10-c36). The in-lab protocol considers nine alkanes from c10 to c36. Standard annotation includes an hashtag, e.g., #c10. Small fun fact: if you use this annotation even Metmax would be able to determine the retention index. To do so: Open the file: config_mtx/conversion_metabolite.csv Scroll down to the entry Cinnamic acid trans-, 1TMS Verify that InternalStandard is defined in the column Standard Check the annotation of alkanes in Metabolite_manual Define all nine with adding Alk in the column Standard 4.4.8 Process MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.csv We are ready now to start processing the second module of the MTXQCvX2 called the Experimental Setup. In order to faciliate automated data processing throughout MTXQC files and parameters have to be defined beforehand for each project-folder. Defined parameters are saved in the file MTXQC_params.csv inside the project-folder for future reference enabling to move the project-folder independently of the remaining MTXQC-files.

Throughout MTXQCvX2 messages inform about: * Successfull data imports * Fatal errors causing an automatic stop of data processing and * Warnings pointing towards things that should be checked before moving to the next step. 4.4.9 Process MTXQC_part4.Rmd Now everything is prepared to transform our spreadsheet data into proper MTXQCvX2 input files. Please go ahead and define the following parameter to run MTXQC_part4.Rmd: Project folder: t_metmax File containing peak areas: PeakAreas.csv File containing mz 73 values: mz73.csv File containing MIDs: MIDs.csv Generate file for internal standard: (check) Generate file for alkanes: (check) Generate file for sum of area normalisation: (check) Generate ManualQuantTable and samples file: (check) Determine isotope incorporation: (check) After the successfull processing you should find the parameter file Metmax_params.csv inside your project folder, as well as all files in their correct input-folders.

I highly recommend to create a local copy of your data and then import it into ChromaToF. ChromaToF is not the fastest software and the server doesn’t help for sure with that. For each data processing (DP) method you need to define tasks by checking boxes at the top of the window. With each ticked box the related parameter that can be modified are listed below that list of tasks. So always remeber to scroll down, and after setting parameters, scroll up and check your ticks another time. In general you first adjust the choice of DP method first and apply it subsequently - choose one file, right click and choose Process data. Select all files and the DP method. 13.1 Import data into ChromaToF Create a new project folder in the menu Acquired Samples and rename it, e.g., with the date and project name. Click on the folder to activate it. Now you can move down a window, just right click somewhere in this window and choose Import data. Select your .SMP files and wait until ChromaToF is done. 13.2 DP - Resampling Resampling is commonly applied and results into a data transformation enabling an improved detection of low abundant peaks and a reduction of noise. (Maybe include an example?) The processing methods requires to tick the task Export data file. Subsequently, you are asked to define an output folder and the following paramter: Reduction rate: 4 From the beginning to end of the file .peg-files In the next step the generated files have to be re-imported into a subfolder in Acquired Samples in ChromaToF. Create subfolder called resample in ChromaToF Right-click file window below Import .peg-files 13.3 DP - 1D-basic Please check the following task in ChromaToF Data Processing (DP) Methods: Baseline Peak Find Library Search Calculate Area / Height Retention Index Method Baseline enter baseline tracking from start of the run until end of run baseline offset 1 number of data points for smoothing: auto Peak Find peak width: 4 maximum number of unknown peaks to find: 600 S/N: 50.0 library identity: normal library search mode: forward number of library hits returned: 10 min. molecular weigth allowed: 0 max. molecular weight allowed: 1500 mass threshold: 0 min. similarity match: 0 Add libraries: gmd-merged-kempa Calculate Area / Height enter mass to use: U Retention Index Method choose your retention index method 13.3.1 Create the Retention Index Method Before proceeding with applying processing method you need to prepare the Retention Index Method. Create a new Retention Index Method: Scroll down in the main menu and click on Retention Index Methods Right click on the white in the window below Select new Rename it This creates an empty table in the main window. Use the blue plus sign and add nine rows. If you cannot click on the plus, make sure you clicked the name of the retention indey method before. Adjust the entries the following way: Change names: #c10, #c12, #c15, #c17, #c19, #c22, #c28, #c32, #c36 Retention Index is equal to the product of number of carbons and 100 (RI of #c10 is 1000) Verification Mass: 85 Go back to your measurements and select a wash run. Select the alkane masses, normally saved in shortcut B, and collect the retention times. Add these values in the retention index method. All done, select the retention index method in data processing methods. Run the processing method 1D-basic over all your files. 13.4 Reference search 13.4.1 Create a reference in ChromaToF 13.4.2 Process your reference search Check the task and following parameter: Apply Reference(s): S/N: 10 - 50 Mass Threshold: 0 Add the references Very important Always scroll up and check the ticked tasks again. Always… and really always when you change the reference ChromaToF checks the PeakFind option for you. But this we definitely do not want since the basic processing just pre-annotated all peaks that were detected and identifiable. If you forget to uncheck the box only the compounds listed in your reference are annotated, all other annotations are replaced with unknown and a number. 13.5 Export for Metmax Check tasks in `data processing methods: Export peak information ASCII CSV format define the directory where files should be saved field separator: TAB filter: choose all but not Not Founds sort by: Name, ascending exportet information: Name Concerns Quant Masses Area Expected Ion Ratio 1 Calibration Match Quant S/N Similarity Type Concentration Sample Concentration 1st Dimension Time (s) Retention Index R.T.

The header of metmax-extracted files looks like shown below (see table 1). Please, remember to delete the second header row, representing the column loads for each file before saving as csv-file. Otherwise you end up with weird imported dataframes in R. Quantification masses have to be updated while processing in ChromaToF prior the export of the data e.g., with a reference search (see section ??] or using statistical compare. pSIRM experiments require the definition of pTop5 masses; an extended list of quant masses considering isotope incorporation instead of top5 masses in the reference in order to take into account the shift of intensities induced by the application of stable isotopes26 (see somewhere). name mass ri row.load file_1 file_2 file_x Lac 219 1051 0.76 15423 135444 465486 Pyr 174 1042 0.65 56978 46888 4354544 Cit 273 1805 0.99 1326 23321 132121 MTXQC_part4 takes care of the formatting and correct column names of the peak areas file and saves it in input/quant/quantMassAreasMatrix.csv. MTXQC_part4 generates also the file PeakDensities-Chroma.csv and saves it in input/gc/PeakDensities-Chroma.csv in case you have selected the option to include sum of area normalisation while knitting this module. 13.6.2 Isotope incorporation - MIDs.csv27 In order to determine the incorporation of stable isotopes MTXQCvX2 requires as an input the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) for each intermediate and measurement28. Fragments for each intermediate have to be pre-defined in metmax in the menue Tools/Options/metabolite masses. You can import a prepared list (have a look at inst/template_files/MetMax_MIDs.txt) or specify each entry manually. An example of the metmax output is shown in table 2.

The mathematics behind are outlined in (Pietzke et al. 2014) Important: Extracted MIDs have to match with defined mass couples for each metabolite in MTXQCvX2 defined in config_mtx/incorpo_calc_masses.csv. Please refer for more details in chapter 11. 13.6.3 Derivatisation efficiency - mz73.csv30 The extraction of intensities for the ion \\(m/z 73\\) works analogous to the extraction of MIDs31. Mass ranges have to be defined for each intermediate for the mass 73 by defining starting and end mass with 73. MTXQC_part4 generates the file and saves it in input/gc/MassSum-73.csv.

If you do not find an answer to your question - please create an issue directly in the github repository32 or write an e-mail. 14.1 How do I create my annotation-file? The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - File and Type - are obligatory and have to be present in the annotation file. In the case of their absence MTXQCvX_part1.Rmd stops processing and shows an error message. A quick way to generate an annotation file is described below: Copy the first row / header of quantMassAreaMatrix.csv file Paste &amp; transpose the content into a new Excel-File into column A Change the first entry: Metabolite -&gt; File Remove the entry QuantMasses at the very end of the column A Add the column Type and specify each file either as sample, Q1_dilution or addQ1_dilution33 Add more columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment34 Save the content as csv-file in, e.g., psirm_glucose/input/... 14.2 How do I create the file sample_extracts.csv? The sample_extracts.csv file is required in order to determine automatically absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue in the CalculationFileData.csv. This file requires two obligatory columns - Extract_vol and Unit35. Please specify for each experimental condition the amount of extracted cells (count), tissue (mg) or volume of blood/plasme (ul) in the unit shown in the brackets. The names of the columns of the experimental conditions have to match up with the annotation file. Save the file in the folder psirm_glucose/input/.... If the defined experimental conditions do not match up with the annotation MTXQC_part1.Rmd exit data processing. A template file is saved for review and usage at inst/template_files/... 14.3 How do I define an internal extraction standard other than cinnamic acid? MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal extraction standards. The only thing you need to do is to define the corresponding compounds as an internal standard in the config_mtx/conversion_metabolite.csv file. To do so, add to the compound in last column Standard the entry InternalStandard. The definition of an internal standard requires the file ‘InternalStandard.csv’ in the folder input/gc since it is used for the evaluation of normalisation factors in MTXQC_part1. Scenario 1 Maui-project and Cinnamic acid For an classical pSIRM experiment in the Kempa lab we are using cinnamic acid. The evaluation of this compound has been integrated into Maui. Peak areas of cinnamic acid are exported from the container called cinAcid. The exported file36 has to be renamed to InternalStandard.csv though and moved to psirm_glucose/input/gc/.... Scenario 2 Maui-project and different internal standard If you have used a different compound as an internal extraction standard you might need to extract the peak areas of this compound from the file quantPeakAreasMatrix.csv and save it in the folder psirm_glucose/input/gc/InternalStandard.csv, respectively. Prerequisite here - you have annotated the compound in your Maui-project. Scenario 3 Metmax-project In the case you used metmax the module MTXQC_part4.Rmd takes care for you of the generation of the InternalStandard.csv based on the definition in conversion_metabolite.csv and provided peak areas37. This procedure is independent what standard you have defined. It only requires the annotation of your compound in chromtof and successful export with metmax. 14.4 How do I combine multiple MAUI-projects into a single MTXQC-project? Certain circumstances might wish you to combine multiple MAUI-projects into one MTXQC-project. This might be the case when you run the same samples in split and splitless mode on the machine or your experimental setup has been measured in multiple batches in order to avoid derivatisation effects. It is highly recommended to combine the input files derived from a different Maui projects beforehand the analysis. In that way you have only to work with a single file CalculationFileData.csv38 containing all data of the your experiment. The herein described process provides a quick way how to combine the exported files from different Maui projects. The script combine-sets.R39 automatically saves all combined files into the correct input folder. Just update the folder and subfolder names. All the rest has been taken care of for you. Create in the MTXQC-project folder (e.g., psirm_glucose/) a new folder called raw-data Create a subfolder for each Maui-project in psirm_glucose/raw_data/... Copy into this folder all your Maui-derived input files altogether Update the parameter of combine-sets.R, meaning folder name definitions, file Execute the R script Merged files have been generated and copied into the corresponding folder: psirm_glucose/input-folder/gc/... or psirm_glucose/input-folder/inc/... Copy the renamed ManualQuantTable.tsv files of each Maui project into psirm_glucose/input/quant/... 14.5 How do I extend conversion_metabolite.csv At a certain point you might want to add a compound or derivate that is not part of the current setup of metabolites. For simplicity we assume you want to add an intermediate for quantitative and isotope incorporation40. In order to include this new compound you need to add information to the following files in config_mtx: conversion_metabolite.csv letter_pathway_complete.csv incorp_calc_masses.csv mid_backups.csv If you desire the absolute quantification of this new compound you most probably need to either: (1) include the compound in quant-standards or (2) measure additional quantification standards. Please read sections 14.8, @ref(#quantind) and 14.10 how to proceed. conversion_metabolite.csv Define the three variations - Metabolite, Metaboite_short, Lettercode - of the compound name by analogy with the present list (text) Q1_value: check only if this compound is part of a quantification mix (x) Mass_Pos: define the m/z-value reflecting the shift of intensity in case of the incorporation of stable isotopes (numeric) SE_sel: check only if MID exports are available (x) Q_sel: nopsirm: check if this compound should not considered for isotope inc.

["18-psirm.html", "Chapter 18 pSIRM experiments 18.1 Experimental design 18.2 Experimental procedures 18.3 Protocol pSIRM 18.4 Hints &amp; notes", " Chapter 18 pSIRM experiments The application of stable isotopes provides a powerful tool to track the activity of metabolic pathways. the time-dependent and atom-specific routing along a metabolic pathway resolved how substrates like glucose or glutamine are used in order to maintain a certain phenotype and energetic homeostatsis. We developed an approach called pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM) enabling the quantitative evaluation of metabolite pool sizes and incorporation of stable isotopes, e.g., \\(^{13}C_6\\)-glucose. A thoughtful setup of the experimental design including the applied substrates and carefull experimental handling are prerequisites for a successful pSIRM experiment. Essential aspects are collected in the below paragraphs along with a number of usefull tweaks. 18.1 Experimental design An in vitro pSIRM experiment lasts in total up to three days starting from the cell seeding at day zero. Further along the way up to two media changes should be included until the application of stable isotopes and harvesting the cells maintaining the continouse availability of nutrients and avoiding the accumulation of waste products (Figure (fig:psirm)). The media change four hours prior the harvest is set up in order to give cells time to recover from the mechanical stress of the media change. At the time point of harvest cells should be in a perfect happily state regarding metabolic environment and stress. Choose carefully the seeding density of you cells in the first place. High confluency inducing contact inhibition of cell growth has a strong impact on several cellular processes including the uptake of nutrients. Try to aim for petri dishes with a maximum confluency of 75-80 %. A pre-experiment including different cell densities for seeding at a number of experimental conditions helps you to get a feeling for the cell growth in general and an expected output of cells at the time point of the harvest. Later one is useful to plan sample extraction and measurement subsequently. Figure 18.1: Experimental design of a pSIRM experiment distuingishing short and long labeling with stable isotopes. For adherent cell cultures only: Include for each experimental condition an additional petri dish that is solely used to determine the cell count at the time point of your harvest. This additional plate ensures a correct determination of absolute quantities and might reduce variation of pool sizes in the statistical analysis41. Think carefully about control conditions and include cell culture dishes that are not labeled. These dishes function as a control for your labeling procedure and the natural abundance of isotopes. 18.2 Experimental procedures There is a slight difference in the protocols for adherent and suspension cells. Please read instructions and footnotes carefully. Short42 and long term labeling procured differ only in the applied solvents during the labeling - either label buffer (LB) only or a combination of full label medium (LM) and label buffer (LB). Latter one is applied in order to remove extracellular metabolites of the media. Both label buffer and media contain the major nutrients / stable isotopes to keep the main substrates at constant supply at all times (Table 18.1). During the application of stable isotopes longer than a few minutes cells might sense the absence of further intermediates provided during standard cell culture procedure and and adjust their metabolic program accordingly. Table 18.1: Solvent composition of Full label medium (LM) and label buffer (BF) for a pSIRM experiment labeling with 13C-glucose. Solvent Base Carbon.source Supplements Full label medium (LM) DMEM, without glucose, glutamine, pyruvate 13C-Glc (2.5 g/L) 12C-Gln (2 mM) small molecules (inhibitor, antibiotics) Label buffer (LB) HEPES (5 mM), NaCl (140 mM), pH 7.4 13C-Glc (2.5 g/L) 12C-Gln (2 mM) The quality of your data later heavily relies on the exact handling of the cells and a consistent timing throughout the pSIRM experiment. Especially the step removing the LB and quenching the cells should be a matter of a tenth of seconds rather than seconds. It is of great value to perform the cell harvest with a second person. 18.3 Protocol pSIRM 18.3.1 Adherent cell cultures The herein described protocols are detailed explanations how to perform a pSIRM cell harvest for long term label application. If you want to label for less than 2 minutes omit solely omit steps 6-8. Materials: Cell culture dishes, max. confluency 80 % Labeling media (LM) supplemented with substrates (5 ml / dish)43 Label buffer (LB) supplemented with substrates (5 ml / dish) Ice-cold 50 % MeOH supplemented with 2 ug/ul cinnamic acid 2x 5 ml pipette and tips44 Beaker Ice 15 ml falcons (chloroform resistant) Cell lifter Biological waste bin next to your bench Procedure: Pre-warm LB and LM in the water bath Take a number of petri dishes (condition-wise including all biol. replicates) Discard cell culture media Carefully add long term labeling LM OR short term labeling: LB Incubate cells on the bench or in an incubator Discard LM (beaker) Add immediatly 5 ml of LB Rotate dish once in order to cover complete surface Meanwhile 2nd person get prepared with 5 ml ice-cold MeOH Discard LB into beaker and immediatly 2nd person quenches with ice-cold MeOH Collect cell extracts using cell lifter Transfer cell extracts into 15 ml falcons Store falcons on ice until further processing Repeat this procedure (step 6-10) for all dishes of a single condition first. Once MeOH is added metabolic processes are interrupted and cell extracts can be collected with the help of cell lifter without rush and subsequently transfered to 15 ml falcon and stored on ice until further processing (see chapter Cell extraction methanolic extracts). Determine the cell count using your additional petri dishes for each condition. 18.3.2 Supension cell cultures Materials: Cell culture flasks Labeling media (LM) supplemented with substrates 5 ml pipette and tips45 1 ml pipette Beaker paper tissues Liquid nitrogen 15 ml falcons 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes Biological waste bin next to your bench Procedure: Pre-warm LM in the water bath Determine the cell count of your cell suspension(s) Take aliquots of \\(10-15e+6\\) cells and transfer into 15 ml falcon Spin down cells very gently 300 g, 2 min at room temperature Discard media into beaker Resuspend cells gently in three-times 1 ml46 Incubate and keep warm Fractionate cell supension in three eppendorf tubes (3x 1 ml each) Spin down quickly in top-bench centrifuge47 Discard media blandtly on paper tissues Snap-freeze immediatly in liquid nitrogen Store cells until further processing (see chapter Cell extraction suspension cells) The important step here to be quick is the alquotation of the cell suspension and subsequent spin down in the table centrifuge. Suspension cells are rather small, nevertheless \\(3e+6\\) cells per extract are a good starting point for GC-MS measurements. 18.4 Hints &amp; notes The only way to be reproducible and fast is to team up with a second person. Keep timing consistently through the experiment. Keep substrate concentrations constant throughout the experiment in all solutions. Supplement one stable isotopic labeled substrate with all remaining substrates in non-labeled form. Think about nutrient levels in your cell culture and your experimental conditions. Maybe you want to change things to physiological levels. Add additional plate to each condition in order to have material for western blotting and others. Check carefully the confluency of your dishes and determine seeding densities for different conditions. In case of small molecule inhibitors: Try to avoid to solve them in DMSO - strong impact on chromatography. Pelleting these cells and snap-freezing might give usefull additional samples for western blotting.↩ I would rather recommend this up to 2 min of labeling↩ Not required for short term labeling↩ Highly recommended, makes labeling and harvest super quick↩ Highly recommended, makes labeling and harvest super quick↩ To generate three replicates↩ Most of the times 30 s are already enough↩ "],
