\chapter{Introduction MTXQCvX documentation}\label{intro}}

This documentation introduces to you how to use MTXQCvX2 in order to run a first straight-forward data analysis of your metabolomics experiment. The underling experimental and mathematical concepts have been introduced for the pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM) approach published in \citep{Pietzke2014}.

This documentation shows you how to use MTXQCvX2 in order to assess the quality of your GC-MS derived data, perform the determination of calibration curves and absolute quantification. It furthermore provides you two normalisation strategies and the calculation of quantities in, e.g., pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue.

MTXQCvX2 does also enable the calculation of stable isotopic incorporation and the evaluation of the underlying data, the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs).

The tool has been set up to support the in-lab developed workflow for quantitative metabolomics experiments using the in-house developed software Maui for the annotation of data. MTXQCvX2 bridges the gap between quality control and first data post-processing / analysis of GC-MS derived data (MTXQCvX2\_part1, MTXQCvX2\_part2).

Nevertheless MTXQCvX2 includes a module in order to integrate all kind of data provided in spreadsheet-format, e.g., derived from metmax, extracting required information and creating corresponding files (MTXQCvX2\_part4).

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\section{Structure}\label{structure}}

MTXQCvX2 contains a suite of modules is optimized to process GC-MS derived data and processed either in Maui or Chromatof/Metmax. Workflows for both approaches are introduced with step-by-step tutorials in chapter \ref{maui} and \ref{metmax}.

Subsequently each MTXQCvX2 module is introduced in greater detail including the list of processing parameter (chapter \ref{ExpSetup} - \ref{Metmax}).

The configuration of MTXQCvX2 has been split into two categories - (1) a general configuration \texttt{config\_files} and (2) metabolomics specific parameters \texttt{config\_mtx}. Latter one is meant to provide flexibility to adapt MTXQCvX2 to your needs. How to do so and what files can be customizes is shown in chapter \ref{config}.

Workflow-specific processing methods applied in Chromatof are introduced separately in the chapter \ref{mauiproc} and \ref{metmaxproc} including all parameter as well as a short introduction.

The remaining chapter cover a chapter for frequently asked questions (chapter\ref{FAQ}) that might give you a hint where to search for the information you are looking for.

The appendix summarises technical reference material in the form of a dictionary of tables (chapter \ref{tables}), protocols for the pSIRM workflow \ref{psirm} and a complete distinct chapter listing protocols (chapter \ref{protocols}) including standard and sample preparation and derivatisation (chapter \ref{SampleExtraction} and \ref{Deriv}) and the current setting of the GC-ToF-MS machine (chapter \ref{gcms}).

\hypertarget{how-to-use-this-documentation}{%
\section{How to use this documentation}\label{how-to-use-this-documentation}}

This documentation provides for each level the right starting point. Complete newbies are highly suggested to start with one of the two tutorials and following the step-by-step descriptions using the example datasets.
Also if you are using for the first time please go through to the chapter once to be aware of all the steps that are required to succeed.

Experienced users might be referred to the explanation of the individual modules or to the how-to-guides for data processing and the FAQs section.

\hypertarget{create-a-r-project}{%
\subsection{Create a R-project}\label{create-a-r-project}}

R-projects provide a secure environment to handle your data from the processing in MTXQCvX2 until the final reports and analysis. Think about it as a big bubble containing and carrying all your data and analysis savely from one place to the other undisturbed of the outside changes.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open R-studio and create a new project following: \texttt{File\ -\textgreater{}\ New\ project\ -\textgreater{}\ New\ Project\ -\textgreater{}\ New\ Directory} and call the directory \texttt{tutorial\_single\_maui} and the preferred subdirectory.
\item
  I recommend to start each project in a new session (tick the box at the bottom of the dialogue box).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{copy-mtxqcvx2-template-files}{%
\subsection{Copy MTXQCvX2 template files}\label{copy-mtxqcvx2-template-files}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Download the current version of MTXQCvX2 called fluffy adventure\footnote{github.com/ChrisZasada/fluffy\_adventure}
\item
  Open and extract the zip-folder
\item
  Copy all folders and files into your R-project 'tutorial\_single\_maui`
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{process-mtxqc_init.rmd}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_init.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_init.rmd}}

The module \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd} performs two important steps:
1. Check-up package installation
2. Creation of project-folder

The project folder is supposed to provide a tidy structure while data processing and analysis and contains several pre-defined folder. Besides the following folders: `input', `output' and `figures' you see a detailed subfolder structure. You find more details about each folder and additional suggestion how to use project-folder in chapter \ref{init}.

All you need to do is to process the \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd}. The following procedure is how you process all \texttt{.Rmd}-files of MTXQCvX2:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Click on the small black triangle next to the ball of yarn in the R-Studio toolbar
\item
  Choose \texttt{Knit\ with\ Parameters...}
\end{itemize}

If the \texttt{.Rmd}-file contains defined parameters a shiny dialogue pops up and provides an interactive selection based on the document. In the case of \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd} you are asked to define a so-called project-folder, e.g., \texttt{psirm\_glucose}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Define the name of the project-folder:} psirm\_glucose
\end{itemize}

Check in the files tab of R-Studio, browse through it and get familiar with the structure. This is the home of your metabolomics projects data analysis.

\hypertarget{prepare-and-copy-input-files}{%
\subsection{Prepare and copy input files}\label{prepare-and-copy-input-files}}

Several files have to be exported from Maui and copied into the folders \texttt{input/gc}, \texttt{input/quant} and \texttt{input/inc} for the evaluation of the GC-MS performance, absolute quantification and isotope incorporation.

Please follow the detailed instructions in section \ref{mauiexport} if you need further information how to perform the export in Maui. For the purpose of the tutorial the exported files are already processed and provided in tutorial dataset \texttt{input}-folder.
Select each file and copy it to the correct location inside your R-project.

\hypertarget{copy-files-annotation.csv-and-sample_extracts.csv}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Copy files: \texttt{annotation.csv} and \texttt{Sample\_extracts.csv}}{Copy files: annotation.csv and Sample\_extracts.csv}}\label{copy-files-annotation.csv-and-sample_extracts.csv}}

Both files contain important information about your metabolomics experiment and since these information are highly specific you need to create them on your own and save them in \texttt{project-folder/input/}.

Browse to both files in the tutorial dataset, have a look at the content and copy both files into \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input}.

\textbf{The annotation file}

The herein shown \emph{annotation file} contains information about the eperimental conditions of each sample and measurement file. The columns \textbf{File} and \textbf{Type} are mandatory and the minimum content of an annotation file. Additional columns defining further conditions, like cell line or glucose level, are totally customizable to your preferences.

Though, I suggest to set up a maximum of four parameter. If your project requires more try to create combinations. Later on this helps to visualise your data using MTXQC\_part2. The number of parameters is limited by the availabily of diagram axes, facets and paper size. Subsequently written individual reports are independent of this and conditions could be split and extended without any limitations.

\textbf{The sample extrats file}

The \emph{sample extracts} file specify the nature and volume / weight of the sample extracts. The columns \textbf{Extract\_vol} and \textbf{Unit} (count, mg or ul) are mandatory here.

The minimal file contains these two columns with at least one row / entry, e.g. \(1.5e+6\) \& count. This would result into the association of \(1.5e+6\) cells to each file.

This file here in this tutorial shows cell extracts defined with the unit \emph{count} for specific conditions. Please be aware that names of experimental conditions have to match between annotation and sample extracts file.

Nevertheless it is not necessarily required to define for each combination of conditions a cell count. Please refer FAQs section \ref{createannotation} and \ref{createsampleextracts} for further information how to create and set up both files from the scretch.

\hypertarget{define-an-internal-standard---cinnamic-acid}{%
\subsection{Define an internal standard - cinnamic acid}\label{define-an-internal-standard---cinnamic-acid}}

The tutorials dataset contains data derived from a classical pSIRM experiment. This includes that the experimentalist supplemented the extraction solvent with an internal extraction standard - cinnamic acid.
All that we have to do is to check if this compound has been defined as \texttt{InternalStandard} in the file \texttt{config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolite.csv}.

To do so:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open the file: 'config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolite.csv`
\item
  Scroll down to the entry \texttt{Cinnamic\ acid\ trans-,\ 1TMS}
\item
  Verify that \texttt{InternalStandard} is defined in the column \texttt{Standard}
\item
  Save the file and close it
\end{itemize}

Read the section \ref{defineinternal} how to proceed in case you want to define a different compound as internal standard.

\hypertarget{process-mtxqc_experimentalsetup.csv}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process \texttt{MTXQC\_ExperimentalSetup.csv}}{Process MTXQC\_ExperimentalSetup.csv}}\label{process-mtxqc_experimentalsetup.csv}}

We are ready now to start processing the second module of the MTXQCvX2 called the Experimental Setup.
In order to faciliate automated data processing throughout MTXQC files and parameters have to be defined beforehand for each project-folder.

Defined parameters are saved in the file \texttt{MTXQC\_params.csv} inside the project-folder for future reference enabling to move the project-folder independently of the remaining MTXQC-files. A huge advantage for debugging and sharing your project\footnote{Just zip-file the project-folder and send it via mail.}

Define the following parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Define project-folder:} psirm\_glucose
\item
  \textbf{Define input-format:} maui
\item
  \textbf{Name of annotation file:} annotation.csv
\item
  \textbf{Name of sample extracts file:} sample\_extracts.csv
\item
  \textbf{Type of experiment:} pSIRM
\item
  \textbf{Applied 13C-substrates:} glc
\item
  \textbf{Internal standard:} check
\item
  \textbf{Type of samples:} cell extracts
\item
  \textbf{Additional calibration curves:} no
\item
  \textbf{Integrate add. calibration curves:} no
\item
  \textbf{Quantification standards:} Quant1\_v3
\item
  \textbf{Volume polar phase of Quants:} 500
\item
  \textbf{Technical replicates:}\footnote{Also called backups} no
\end{itemize}

Confirm the parameter and file definition and wait a moment. Check if you can find the file \texttt{MTXQC\_params.csv} and also \texttt{Maui\_params.csv}. Latter one is automatically generated by selecting maui project as input format. \texttt{Maui\_params.csv} contains the information of the pre-defined file names containing all required input data.

Have a look at the produced pdf-file and check the comments and messages. Throughout MTXQCvX2 messages inform about:
* Successfull data imports
* Fatal errors causing an automatic stop of data processing and
* Warnings pointing towards things that should be checked before moving to the next step.

\hypertarget{process-mtxqc_part1.rmd}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process \texttt{MTXQC\_part1.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_part1.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_part1.rmd}}

Since we have defined all required input parameter the main module is ready to run after the definition of only three parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition of the project-folder:} psirm\_glucose
\item
  \textbf{Type of data:} maui
\item
  \textbf{Manual validated data:} none
\end{itemize}

Also here, scroll carefully through the generated pdf-file and have a look at the messages. If all works out it doesn't matter, but it might help to know what should be written if you end up with an error message instead of.

Each generated graphic is going to be explained in detail in chapter \ref{part1}. For now please refer to my phd thesis \citep{Zasada2017}.

All quality metrices are visualised on the last page of the report split into two heatmaps:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  GC-performance (orange): across all measurements
\item
  Quantification \& isotope incorporation (blue): for each intermediate individually, but across all exp. conditions
\end{itemize}

Besides the generation of the MTXQC\_part1 report several \texttt{csv-files} are exported into the output folder summarising statistics of all quality control metrices. The content of each file is summarised in the dictionary of tables (chapter \ref{tables}).

The most important file \texttt{CalculationFileData.csv} summarises all experimental conditions, normalisation factors as well as information about calibration curve parameter and derived quantities. You find this file here - \texttt{project-folder/output/quant/}.

It is worth to open this file in a program of your choice and check for a selected intermediate the content. Wrong assignments of conditions in the annotation or sample extracts-file might cause duplication of values, easily to identify if exactly the same peak areas, so the same file, appears multiple times.

\texttt{CalculationFileData.csv} is all about the absolute quantities and data normalisation. Why does it not contain information about isotope incorporation you might ask. Well, depending on the experimental setup you might follow different ways how to combine both entities. Furthermore \texttt{MTXQC\_part1} is not about doing any processing of the data in the sense of analysis or statistics\footnote{Quality metrices are a different pair of shoes here and are not data per se}. It is supposed to assess the quality meaning the evaluation of the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) that are the basis for the calculation of the isotope incorporation.

The next module has been set up to give you a first quick report about the content of your data performing basic post processing steps inclduing the statistics part.

\hypertarget{process-mtxqc_part2.rmd}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process \texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_part2.rmd}}

This module aims to provide you a quick overview of your data. It generates, based on your parameter definition while processing this file, statistics of quantities for each intermediate as well as isotope incorporation and 13C-labeled quantities.

A senseful association of your experimental parameter might provide you even ready-to-show plots for a presentation or report. Different color schemes are in place to meet your personal taste - play a bit and find your favorite ;).

All kind of outputs (graphics, statistics) are saved at \texttt{output/quant/...} into a day-specific folder\footnote{Called: Date\_PostProcessing\_AnalysisParam\_QuantitativeValue}, meaning if you repeat the same analysis several times a day the content is replaced with each run\footnote{Same thing for the generated pdf-report so I recommend to move it into the post processing folder for future reference}. Simply modify the folder name to avoid this behaviour. If you go on with your analysis the next or another day a new folder is created.

Go and process this module with the following parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Project-folder:} psirm\_glucose
\item
  \textbf{Type of analysis:} stringent
\item
  \textbf{Internal standard:} QC\footnote{meaning, that all the internal standard has to be within a defined range of variation, files with higher variation are excluded from the analysis}
\item
  \textbf{Quantitative value:} InstStd\_Conc\_pmio\footnote{Translated: Normalised (regarding the internal standard) quantities in (pmol/1e+6 cells)}
\item
  \textbf{par1:} time
\item
  \textbf{par2:} substrate
\item
  \textbf{par3:} whatelse
\item
  \textbf{par4:} none
\item
  \textbf{updated:} none
\item
  \textbf{pre-defined color scheme:} choose yourself
\end{itemize}

Feel free to add further plots at the end of this report if required or define your project specific color code at the beginning of the document.

I recommend to use the output of \texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd} as a kind of overall visualisation of the data. Specific questions might be addressed in smaller reports using the output-files of \texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}.

I furthermore suggest to process both type of analysis - stringent and less stringent - to get an impression at what points the manual validation of distinct intermediates might be useful.

\hypertarget{at-the-end}{%
\section{At the end\ldots{}}\label{at-the-end}}

So far you have used MTXQCvX2 to generate two reports:
1. one summarising the quality of the generated data and
2. a first statistical overview about the content of your data.

With this the tutorial ends and refers to the plenty of detailed information scattered in a number of additional chapters of this documentation.
The FAQ section tries to guide you through more specific settings and introduces you to the flexibility of MTXQCvX2.

Since every metabolomics experiment has it's own purpose and reasoning I want to point out, that MTXQCvX2 does not want to provide a magical tool giving the perfect solution for everyone. It rather tries to provide a common platform for discussions, information exchange and inspiration by reducing the time that has to be spend on ``the boring part of research''. There is no limit to make MTXQC your own perfect tool writing your own reports and extensions. Feel free and hoepfully motivated to share your report as a template with your colleagues.

All you need to do is to process the \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd}. The following procedure is how you process all \texttt{.Rmd}-files of MTXQCvX2:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Click on the small black triangle next to the ball of yarn in the R-Studio toolbar
\item
  Choose \texttt{Knit\ with\ Parameters...}
\end{itemize}

If the \texttt{.Rmd}-file contains defined parameters a shiny dialogue pops up and provides an interactive selection based on the document. In the case of \texttt{MTXQC\_init.Rmd} you are asked to define a so-called project-folder.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Define the name of the project-folder:} \texttt{t\_metmax}
\end{itemize}

Check in the files tab of R-Studio, browse through it and get familiar with the structure. This is the home of your metabolomics projects data analysis.

\hypertarget{copy-input-files-fom-tutorial-dataset}{%
\subsection{Copy input files fom tutorial dataset}\label{copy-input-files-fom-tutorial-dataset}}

\texttt{MTXQC\_part4.Rmd} convienently transform spreadsheet kind of data extracted with Metmax into suitable input files in the style of Maui input files. You do not need necessarily provide all three kind of information (peak areas, MIDs and m/z 73 values). It depends on the scope and setup of your metabolomics experiment.

If you need detailed instructions how to use metmax have a look at the section \ref{metmaxproc}. The input files of the tutorial dataset have to be copied from `input/metmax/' into your R-project and project folder at the same location.

Copy the files into \texttt{tutorial/input/t\_metmax/}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  PeakAreas.csv and
\item
  mz73.csv
\item
  MIDs.csv
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{copy-files-annotation.csv-and-sample_extracts.csv-1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Copy files: \texttt{annotation.csv} and \texttt{Sample\_extracts.csv}}{Copy files: annotation.csv and Sample\_extracts.csv}}\label{copy-files-annotation.csv-and-sample_extracts.csv-1}}

Both files contain important information about your metabolomics experiment and since these information are highly specific you need to create them on your own and save them in \texttt{project-folder/input/}.

Browse to both files in the tutorial dataset, have a look at the content and copy both files into \texttt{t\_metmax/input}.

\textbf{The annotation file}

The herein shown \emph{annotation file} contains information about the eperimental conditions of each sample and measurement file. The columns \textbf{File} and \textbf{Type} are mandatory and the minimum content of an annotation file. Additional columns defining further conditions, like cell line or glucose level, are totally customizable to your preferences.

Though, I suggest to set up a maximum of four parameter. If your project requires more try to create combinations. Later on this helps to visualise your data using MTXQC\_part2. The number of parameters is limited by the availabily of diagram axes, facets and paper size. Subsequently written individual reports are independent of this and conditions could be split and extended without any limitations.

\textbf{The sample extrats file}

The \emph{sample extracts} file specify the nature and volume / weight of the sample extracts. The columns \textbf{Extract\_vol} and \textbf{Unit} (count, mg or ul) are mandatory here.

The minimal file contains these two columns with at least one row / entry, e.g. \(1.5e+6\) \& count. This would result into the association of \(1.5e+6\) cells to each file.

This file here in this tutorial shows cell extracts defined with the unit \emph{count} for specific conditions. Please be aware that names of experimental conditions have to match between annotation and sample extracts file.

Nevertheless it is not necessarily required to define for each combination of conditions a cell count. Please refer FAQs section \ref{createannotation} and \ref{createsampleextracts} for further information how to create and set up both files from the scretch.

\hypertarget{update-metabolite_manual-in-the-file-config_mtxconversion_metabolites.csv}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Update \texttt{Metabolite\_manual} in the file \texttt{config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolites.csv}}{Update Metabolite\_manual in the file config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolites.csv}}\label{update-metabolite_manual-in-the-file-config_mtxconversion_metabolites.csv}}

In order to automatically process through MTXQCvX2 you need to link the names of your intermediates given in ChromaToF with the corresponding metabolites in \texttt{conversion\_metabolites.csv}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open the file \texttt{conversion\_metabolite.csv} and your peak area matrix file
\item
  Update the column `Metabolite\_manual' with the choosen names
\end{itemize}

I suggest to use always a similar format, e.g. \texttt{\#Alanine\_3TMS}. In case of the presence of main- (MP) and byproducts (BP) use: Metabolite\_Derivate\_MP/BP, e.g., Glucose\_(1MEOX)(5TMS)\_MP.
In that way names keep short, easy to remember and effeciently setup in all other files like the metmax import list to extract the MIDs\footnote{Mass isotopomer distribution} for each intermediate.

\hypertarget{define-the-internal-standard-and-alkanes-in-config_mtxconversion_metabolites.csv}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Define the internal standard and alkanes in \texttt{config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolites.csv}}{Define the internal standard and alkanes in config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolites.csv}}\label{define-the-internal-standard-and-alkanes-in-config_mtxconversion_metabolites.csv}}

Both information are specified in the column \texttt{Standard} with either \texttt{InternalStandard} or \texttt{Alk}, respectively. Furhtermore, we need to define cinnamic acid as internal standard and nine alkanes (c10-c36).

The in-lab protocol considers nine alkanes from c10 to c36. Standard annotation includes an hashtag, e.g., \#c10. Small fun fact: if you use this annotation even Metmax would be able to determine the retention index.

To do so:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open the file: \texttt{config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolite.csv}
\item
  Scroll down to the entry \texttt{Cinnamic\ acid\ trans-,\ 1TMS}
\item
  Verify that \texttt{InternalStandard} is defined in the column \texttt{Standard}
\item
  Check the annotation of alkanes in \texttt{Metabolite\_manual}
\item
  Define all nine with adding \texttt{Alk} in the column \texttt{Standard}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{process-mtxqc_experimentalsetup.csv-1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process \texttt{MTXQC\_ExperimentalSetup.csv}}{Process MTXQC\_ExperimentalSetup.csv}}\label{process-mtxqc_experimentalsetup.csv-1}}

We are ready now to start processing the second module of the MTXQCvX2 called the Experimental Setup.
In order to faciliate automated data processing throughout MTXQC files and parameters have to be defined beforehand for each project-folder.

Defined parameters are saved in the file \texttt{MTXQC\_params.csv} inside the project-folder for future reference enabling to move the project-folder independently of the remaining MTXQC-files. A huge advantage for debugging and sharing your project\footnote{Just zip-file the project-folder and send it via mail.}

Define the following parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Define project-folder:} t\_metmax
\item
  \textbf{Define input-format:} metmax
\item
  \textbf{Name of annotation file:} annotation.csv
\item
  \textbf{Name of sample extracts file:} sample\_extracts.csv
\item
  \textbf{Type of experiment:} pSIRM
\item
  \textbf{Applied 13C-substrates:} glc
\item
  \textbf{Internal standard:} check
\item
  \textbf{Type of samples:} cell extracts
\item
  \textbf{Additional calibration curves:} no
\item
  \textbf{Integrate add. calibration curves:} no
\item
  \textbf{Quantification standards:} Quant1\_v4
\item
  \textbf{Volume polar phase of Quants:} 500
\item
  \textbf{Technical replicates:}\footnote{Also called backups} 2
\end{itemize}

Confirm the parameter and file definition and wait a moment. Check if you can find the file \texttt{MTXQC\_params.csv}.

Have a look at the produced pdf-file and check the comments and messages. Throughout MTXQCvX2 messages inform about:
* Successfull data imports
* Fatal errors causing an automatic stop of data processing and
* Warnings pointing towards things that should be checked before moving to the next step.

\hypertarget{process-mtxqc_part4.rmd}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process \texttt{MTXQC\_part4.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_part4.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_part4.rmd}}

Now everything is prepared to transform our spreadsheet data into proper MTXQCvX2 input files. Please go ahead and define the following parameter to run \texttt{MTXQC\_part4.Rmd}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Project folder:} t\_metmax
\item
  \textbf{File containing peak areas:} PeakAreas.csv
\item
  \textbf{File containing mz 73 values:} mz73.csv
\item
  \textbf{File containing MIDs:} MIDs.csv
\item
  \textbf{Generate file for internal standard:} (check)
\item
  \textbf{Generate file for alkanes:} (check)
\item
  \textbf{Generate file for sum of area normalisation:} (check)
\item
  \textbf{Generate ManualQuantTable and samples file:} (check)
\item
  \textbf{Determine isotope incorporation:} (check)
\end{itemize}

After the successfull processing you should find the parameter file \texttt{Metmax\_params.csv} inside your project folder, as well as all files in their correct \texttt{input-folders}.

Have a look and check if you got all of them and have a look at the messages in the \texttt{MTXQC\_part4.Rmd} report.

\hypertarget{process-mtxqc_part1.rmd-1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process \texttt{MTXQC\_part1.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_part1.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_part1.rmd-1}}

Since we have defined all required input parameter the main module is ready to run after the definition of only three parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Definition of the project-folder:} t\_metmax
\item
  \textbf{Type of data:} metmax
\item
  \textbf{Manual validated data:} none
\end{itemize}

Also here, scroll carefully through the generated pdf-file and have a look at the messages. If all works out it doesn't matter, but it might help to know what should be written if you end up with an error message instead of.

Each generated graphic is going to be explained in detail in chapter \ref{part1}. For now please refer to my phd thesis \citep{Zasada2017}.

All quality metrices are visualised on the last page of the report split into two heatmaps:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  GC-performance (orange): across all measurements
\item
  Quantification \& isotope incorporation (blue): for each intermediate individually, but across all exp. conditions
\end{itemize}

Besides the generation of the MTXQC\_part1 report several \texttt{csv-files} are exported into the output folder summarising statistics of all quality control metrices. The content of each file is summarised in the dictionary of tables (chapter \ref{tables}).

The most important file \texttt{CalculationFileData.csv} summarises all experimental conditions, normalisation factors as well as information about calibration curve parameter and derived quantities. You find this file here - \texttt{project-folder/output/quant/}.

It is worth to open this file in a program of your choice and check for a selected intermediate the content. Wrong assignments of conditions in the annotation or sample extracts-file might cause duplication of values, easily to identify if exactly the same peak areas, so the same file, appears multiple times.

\texttt{CalculationFileData.csv} is all about the absolute quantities and data normalisation. Why does it not contain information about isotope incorporation you might ask. Well, depending on the experimental setup you might follow different ways how to combine both entities. Furthermore \texttt{MTXQC\_part1.Rmd} is not about doing any processing of the data in the sense of analysis or statistics\footnote{Quality metrices are a different pair of shoes here and are not data per se}. It is supposed to assess the quality meaning the evaluation of the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) that are the basis for the calculation of the isotope incorporation.

The next module has been set up to give you a first quick report about the content of your data performing basic post processing steps inclduing the statistics part.

\hypertarget{process-mtxqc_part2.rmd-1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Process \texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}}{Process MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}}\label{process-mtxqc_part2.rmd-1}}

This module aims to provide you a quick overview of your data. It generates, based on your parameter definition while processing this file, statistics of quantities for each intermediate as well as isotope incorporation and 13C-labeled quantities.

A senseful association of your experimental parameter might provide you even ready-to-show plots for a presentation or report. Different color schemes are in place to meet your personal taste - play a bit and find your favorite ;).

All kind of outputs (graphics, statistics) are saved at \texttt{output/quant/...} into a day-specific folder\footnote{Called: Date\_PostProcessing\_AnalysisParam\_QuantitativeValue}, meaning if you repeat the same analysis several times a day the content is replaced with each run\footnote{Same thing for the generated pdf-report so I recommend to move it into the post processing folder for future reference}. Simply modify the folder name to avoid this behaviour. If you go on with your analysis the next or another day a new folder is created.

Go and process this module with the following parameter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Project-folder:} t\_metmax
\item
  \textbf{Type of analysis:} less\_stringent
\item
  \textbf{Internal standard:} QC\footnote{meaning, that all the internal standard has to be within a defined range of variation, files with higher variation are excluded from the analysis}
\item
  \textbf{Quantitative value:} InstStd\_Conc\_pmio\footnote{Translated: Normalised (regarding the internal standard) quantities in (pmol/1e+6 cells)}
\item
  \textbf{par1:} Time
\item
  \textbf{par2:} CL
\item
  \textbf{par3:} none
\item
  \textbf{par4:} none
\item
  \textbf{updated:} none
\item
  \textbf{pre-defined color scheme:} choose yourself
\end{itemize}

Feel free to add further plots at the end of this report if required or define your project specific color code at the beginning of the document.

I recommend to use the output of \texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd} as a kind of overall visualisation of the data. Specific questions might be addressed in smaller reports using the output-files of \texttt{MTXQC\_part2.Rmd}.

I furthermore suggest to process both type of analysis - stringent and less stringent - to get an impression at what points the manual validation of distinct intermediates might be useful.

\hypertarget{at-the-end-1}{%

So far you have used MTXQCvX2 to generate two reports:
1. one summarising the quality of the generated data and
2. a first statistical overview about the content of your data.

With this the tutorial ends and refers to the plenty of detailed information scattered in a number of additional chapters of this documentation.
The FAQ section tries to guide you through more specific settings and introduces you to the flexibility of MTXQCvX2.

Since every metabolomics experiment has it's own purpose and reasoning I want to point out, that MTXQCvX2 does not want to provide a magical tool giving the perfect solution for everyone. It rather tries to provide a common platform for discussions, information exchange and inspiration by reducing the time that has to be spend on ``the boring part of research''. There is no limit to make MTXQC your own perfect tool writing your own reports and extensions. Feel free and hoepfully motivated to share your report as a template with your colleagues.

You can perform exports via right click on either (1) the project name and the functions provided in the menue \texttt{Diagnostics} or (2) with a direct right click on data container, e.g.,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open your Maui-project and export:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{Alcane\_intensities.csv}: Diagnostics/Export Alcane intensities
  \item
    \texttt{MassSum-73.csv}: Diagnostics/QC Mass Sum Export and define 73 for m/z 73
  \item
    \texttt{PeakDensities-Chroma.csv}: Diagnostics/Export PeakDensities
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Export the information of the cinnamic acid container with right-click and Export quantification, follow the pop-up dialogues
\item
  Use the explorer and open \texttt{.../mauiproject-name/export/Diagnostics} and copy the csv.files into \texttt{input/gc}
\item
  Navigate to \texttt{.../mauiproject-name/export/ExportQuantification/defined-folder}
\item
  Copy the file \texttt{quantMassAreasMatrix.csv} without applied normalisation and rename it \texttt{InternalStandard.csv}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{subfolder-inputquant}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Subfolder: \texttt{input/quant}}{Subfolder: input/quant}}\label{subfolder-inputquant}}

Two files have to be copied into this folder in order to perform the quantification of metabolites: (1) peak areas of the calibration curves and (2) of all samples.

The first file \texttt{ManualQuantTable.tsv} is automatically generated during the processing of the absolute quantification in Maui.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Navigate in the explorer to \texttt{.../mauiproject-name/export/QM-ManualQuantification/}
\item
  Copy the file \texttt{ManualQuantTable.tsv}
\item
  Rename it with the corresponding batch-id of the GC-MS run (e.g., e17205cz)
\end{itemize}

Peak areas for each measurement and metabolite have to be exported in Maui:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open your Maui-project and export:
\item
  Export the information of the samplePeakGroups container with right-click and Export quantification, follow the instructions
\item
  Navigate in the explorer to \texttt{.../mauiproject-name/export/ExportQuantification/defined-folder}
\item
  Copy the file \texttt{quantMassAreasMatrix.csv} without applied normalisation
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{subfolder-inputinc}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Subfolder \texttt{input/inc}}{Subfolder input/inc}}\label{subfolder-inputinc}}

The evaluation of stable isotope incorporation requires two input files exported from the container pSIRM-samplesPeakGroups, right click and corresponding export function:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{DataMatrix.csv}: Export \% Label
\item
  \texttt{pSIRM\_SpectraData.csv}: pSIRM Spectra Export
\item
  Navigate in the explorer to \texttt{.../mauiproject-name/export/SpectraExport/defined-folder} and \texttt{xy}
\item
  Copy both files, no renaming required
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Data Processing for Metmax}\label{metmaxproc}}

The following steps are done in ChromaToF on the raw data exported from the machine. I highly recommend to create a local copy of your data and then import it into ChromaToF. ChromaToF is not the fastest software and the server doesn't help for sure with that.

For each data processing (DP) method you need to define tasks by checking boxes at the top of the window. With each ticked box the related parameter that can be modified are listed below that list of tasks. So always remeber to scroll down, and after setting parameters, scroll up and check your ticks another time.

In general you first adjust the choice of DP method first and apply it subsequently - choose one file, right click and choose \emph{Process data}. Select all files and the DP method.

\hypertarget{import-data-into-chromatof}{%
\section{Import data into ChromaToF}\label{import-data-into-chromatof}}

Create a new project folder in the menu \texttt{Acquired\ Samples} and rename it, e.g., with the date and project name. Click on the folder to activate it.

Now you can move down a window, just right click somewhere in this window and choose \emph{Import data}. Select your \texttt{.SMP} files and wait until ChromaToF is done.

\hypertarget{dp---resampling}{%
\section{DP - Resampling}\label{dp---resampling}}

Resampling is commonly applied and results into a data transformation enabling an improved detection of low abundant peaks and a reduction of noise. (Maybe include an example?)

The processing methods requires to tick the task \texttt{Export\ data\ file}. Subsequently, you are asked to define an output folder and the following paramter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reduction rate: 4
\item
  From the beginning to end of the file
\item
  \texttt{.peg}-files
\end{itemize}

In the next step the generated files have to be re-imported into a subfolder in \texttt{Acquired\ Samples} in ChromaToF.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create subfolder called \texttt{resample} in ChromaToF
\item
  Right-click file window below
\item
  Import \texttt{.peg}-files
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{dp---1d-basic}{%

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Retention Index Method}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  choose your retention index method
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{createri}{%
\subsection{Create the Retention Index Method}\label{createri}}

Before proceeding with applying processing method you need to prepare the Retention Index Method.

Create a new Retention Index Method:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Scroll down in the main menu and click on Retention Index Methods
\item
  Right click on the white in the window below
\item
  Select new
\item
  Rename it
\end{itemize}

This creates an empty table in the main window. Use the blue plus sign and add nine rows. If you cannot click on the plus, make sure you clicked the name of the retention indey method before.

Adjust the entries the following way:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Change names: \#c10, \#c12, \#c15, \#c17, \#c19, \#c22, \#c28, \#c32, \#c36
\item
  Retention Index is equal to the product of number of carbons and 100 (RI of \#c10 is 1000)
\item
  Verification Mass: 85
\end{itemize}

Go back to your measurements and select a wash run. Select the alkane masses, normally saved in shortcut B, and collect the retention times. Add these values in the retention index method.
All done, select the retention index method in data processing methods.

Run the processing method \texttt{1D-basic} over all your files.

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Very important} Always scroll up and check the ticked tasks again. \textbf{Always\ldots{} and really always} when you change the reference ChromaToF checks the PeakFind option for you. But this we definitely do not want since the basic processing just pre-annotated all peaks that were detected and identifiable. If you forget to uncheck the box only the compounds listed in your reference are annotated, all other annotations are replaced with unknown and a number.

\subsection[Quantification - PeakAreas.csv]{\texorpdfstring{Quantification - PeakAreas.csv\footnote{Required for: all parameter, just not \texttt{calculation\ stable\ isotope\ incorporation}}}{Quantification - PeakAreas.csv}}\label{quantification---peakareas.csv}}

In order to perform absolute quantification you need a file containing all extracted peak areas for each metabolite and file\footnote{Tools/Options/Retention analysis, Parameter: Area}.

The header of metmax-extracted files looks like shown below (see table 1). Please, remember to delete the second header row, representing the column loads for each file before saving as csv-file. Otherwise you end up with weird imported dataframes in R.

Quantification masses have to be updated while processing in ChromaToF prior the export of the data e.g., with a reference search (see section \ref{refsearch}{]} or using statistical compare.
pSIRM experiments require the definition of pTop5 masses; an extended list of quant masses considering isotope incorporation instead of top5 masses in the reference in order to take into account the shift of intensities induced by the application of stable isotopes\footnote{Mandatory columns: name, mass, files} (see \emph{somewhere}).

\begin{tabu} to \linewidth {>{\raggedright}X>{\raggedleft}X>{\raggedleft}X>{\raggedleft}X>{\raggedleft}X>{\raggedleft}X>{\raggedleft}X}

\end{tabu}

MTXQC\_part4 takes care of the formatting and correct column names of the peak areas file and saves it in \texttt{input/quant/quantMassAreasMatrix.csv}.\\
MTXQC\_part4 generates also the file PeakDensities-Chroma.csv and saves it in \texttt{input/gc/PeakDensities-Chroma.csv} in case you have selected the option to include sum of area normalisation while knitting this module.

\subsection[Isotope incorporation - MIDs.csv]{\texorpdfstring{Isotope incorporation - MIDs.csv\footnote{Required for \texttt{calculation\ isotope\ incorporation}}}{Isotope incorporation - MIDs.csv}}\label{isotope-incorporation---mids.csv}}

In order to determine the incorporation of stable isotopes MTXQCvX2 requires as an input the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) for each intermediate and measurement\footnote{Metmax: Tools/Options/Isotope concentrator; Parameter: IntensityOfMass}.
Fragments for each intermediate have to be pre-defined in metmax in the menue Tools/Options/metabolite masses.

You can import a prepared list (have a look at \texttt{inst/template\_files/MetMax\_MIDs.txt}) or specify each entry manually. An example of the metmax output is shown in table 2. The output has to be saved as csv-file, including the deletion of the partial row \texttt{column.load}, respectively\footnote{Mandatory columns: name, mass, files}.

MTXQC\_part4 calculates the stable isotope incorporation and exports DataMatrix.csv as well as pSIRM\_SpectraData.csv saved in \texttt{input/inc/DataMatrix} \& \texttt{pSIRM\_SpectraData.csv}, respectively. The mathematics behind are outlined in \citep{Pietzke2014}

\textbf{Important:}
Extracted MIDs have to match with defined mass couples for each metabolite in MTXQCvX2 defined in \texttt{config\_mtx/incorpo\_calc\_masses.csv}. Please refer for more details in chapter \ref{config}.

The extraction of intensities for the ion \(m/z 73\) works analogous to the extraction of MIDs\footnote{Tools/Options/Isotope concentrator; Parameter: IntensityOfMass}.

Mass ranges have to be defined for each intermediate for the mass 73 by defining starting and end mass with 73. MTXQC\_part4 generates the file and saves it in \texttt{input/gc/MassSum-73.csv}. Check \texttt{inst\textbackslash{}template\_files\textbackslash{}} for reference. Hopefully soon a new metmax button extracting specific intensities across the batch.

\hypertarget{createannotation}{%
\section{How do I create my annotation-file?}\label{createannotation}}

The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - \textbf{File and Type} - are obligatory and have to be present in the annotation file. In the case of their absence \texttt{MTXQCvX\_part1.Rmd} stops processing and shows an error message.

A quick way to generate an annotation file is described below:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Copy the first row / header of \texttt{quantMassAreaMatrix.csv} file
\item
  Paste \& transpose the content into a new Excel-File into column A
\item
  Change the first entry: Metabolite -\textgreater{} File
\item
  Remove the entry QuantMasses at the very end of the column A
\item
  Add the column Type and specify each file either as \textbf{sample}, \textbf{Q1\_dilution} or \textbf{addQ1\_dilution}\footnote{see for further details additionalQuant}
\item
  Add more columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment\footnote{optimal: two to three parameter, at maimumx: four parameter. Consider combinations of parameter, e.g., HCT116-control, HCT116-BPTES}
\item
  Save the content as \texttt{csv-file} in, e.g., \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input/...}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{createsampleextracts}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{How do I create the file \texttt{sample\_extracts.csv}?}{How do I create the file sample\_extracts.csv?}}\label{createsampleextracts}}

The \texttt{sample\_extracts.csv} file is required in order to determine automatically absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue in the \texttt{CalculationFileData.csv}.

This file requires two obligatory columns - \textbf{Extract\_vol} and \textbf{Unit}\footnote{Define: count, mg or ul}. Please specify for each experimental condition the amount of extracted cells (count), tissue (mg) or volume of blood/plasme (ul) in the unit shown in the brackets.\\
The names of the columns of the experimental conditions have to match up with the annotation file. Save the file in the folder \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input/...}.

If the defined experimental conditions do not match up with the annotation \texttt{MTXQC\_part1.Rmd} exit data processing. A template file is saved for review and usage at \texttt{inst/template\_files/...}

\hypertarget{definternal}{%
\section{How do I define an internal extraction standard other than cinnamic acid?}\label{definternal}}

MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal extraction standards. The only thing you need to do is to define the corresponding compounds as an internal standard in the \texttt{config\_mtx/conversion\_metabolite.csv} file. To do so, add to the compound in last column \texttt{Standard} the entry \texttt{InternalStandard}.

The definition of an internal standard requires the file `InternalStandard.csv' in the folder \texttt{input/gc} since it is used for the evaluation of normalisation factors in MTXQC\_part1.

\textbf{Scenario 1} Maui-project and Cinnamic acid

For an classical pSIRM experiment in the Kempa lab we are using cinnamic acid. The evaluation of this compound has been integrated into Maui. Peak areas of cinnamic acid are exported from the container called \texttt{cinAcid}. The exported file\footnote{see section \ref{mauiexports}} has to be renamed to \texttt{InternalStandard.csv} though and moved to \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input/gc/...}.

\textbf{Scenario 2} Maui-project and different internal standard

If you have used a different compound as an internal extraction standard you might need to extract the peak areas of this compound from the file \texttt{quantPeakAreasMatrix.csv} and save it in the folder \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input/gc/InternalStandard.csv}, respectively. Prerequisite here - you have annotated the compound in your Maui-project.

\textbf{Scenario 3} Metmax-project

In the case you used metmax the module \texttt{MTXQC\_part4.Rmd} takes care for you of the generation of the \texttt{InternalStandard.csv} based on the definition in \texttt{conversion\_metabolite.csv} and provided peak areas\footnote{see chapter \ref{Metmax}}.
This procedure is independent what standard you have defined. It only requires the annotation of your compound in chromtof and successful export with metmax.

\hypertarget{multipleproj}{%
\section{How do I combine multiple MAUI-projects into a single MTXQC-project?}\label{multipleproj}}

Certain circumstances might wish you to combine \emph{multiple MAUI-projects} into one MTXQC-project. This might be the case when you run the same samples in split and splitless mode on the machine or your experimental setup has been measured in multiple batches in order to avoid derivatisation effects.

It is highly recommended to combine the input files derived from a different Maui projects beforehand the analysis. In that way you have only to work with a single file \texttt{CalculationFileData.csv}\footnote{stored in \texttt{psirm\_glucose/output/quant/...}} containing all data of the your experiment.

The herein described process provides a quick way how to combine the exported files from different Maui projects. The script \texttt{combine-sets.R}\footnote{inst/template\_files/\ldots{}} automatically saves all combined files into the correct \texttt{input} folder. Just update the folder and subfolder names. All the rest has been taken care of for you.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create in the MTXQC-project folder (e.g., \texttt{psirm\_glucose/}) a new folder called \texttt{raw-data}
\item
  Create a subfolder for each Maui-project in \texttt{psirm\_glucose/raw\_data/...}
\item
  Copy into this folder all your Maui-derived input files altogether
\item
  Update the parameter of \texttt{combine-sets.R}, meaning folder name definitions, file
\item
  Execute the R script
\item
  Merged files have been generated and copied into the corresponding folder: \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input-folder/gc/...} or \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input-folder/inc/...}
\item
  Copy the renamed \texttt{ManualQuantTable.tsv} files of each Maui project into \texttt{psirm\_glucose/input/quant/...}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{extendconse}{%
\section{How do I extend conversion\_metabolite.csv}\label{extendconse}}

At a certain point you might want to add a compound or derivate that is not part of the current setup of metabolites. For simplicity we assume you want to add an intermediate for quantitative and isotope incorporation\footnote{Just skip this if this is not required}.

In order to include this new compound you need to add information to the following files in \texttt{config\_mtx}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{conversion\_metabolite.csv}
\item
  \texttt{letter\_pathway\_complete.csv}
\item
  \texttt{incorp\_calc\_masses.csv}
\item
  \texttt{mid\_backups.csv}
\end{itemize}

If you desire the absolute quantification of this new compound you most probably need to either: (1) include the compound in quant-standards or (2) measure additional quantification standards. Please read sections \ref{quantquant}, @ref(\#quantind) and \ref{addqadds} how to proceed.

\textbf{\texttt{conversion\_metabolite.csv}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Define the three variations - Metabolite, Metaboite\_short, Lettercode - of the compound name by analogy with the present list (text)
\item
  Q1\_value: check only if this compound is part of a quantification mix (x)
\item
  Mass\_Pos: define the m/z-value reflecting the shift of intensity in case of the incorporation of stable isotopes (numeric)
\item
  SE\_sel: check only if MID exports are available (x)
\item
  Q\_sel:
\item
  nopsirm: check if this compound should not considered for isotope inc. (x)
\item
  Standards: define as \emph{InternalStandard} if applicable
\end{itemize}

** \texttt{letter\_pathway\_complete.csv}

** \texttt{ìncorp\_calc\_masses.csv}

Define the couple of m/z-values for your compound:
- m0 - mono-isotopic mass/charge value and
- minc - mass/charge value reflecting shift of intensities

In case you want to define more than one pair of m/z-values have a look at the defined TCA-cycle intermediates.

** \texttt{mid\_backups.csv}

\hypertarget{maui-incorp}{%
\section{How do I define a new mass couple for the automated export of the incorporation in MAUI}\label{maui-incorp}}

Three files have to be updated in order to export the incorporation directly in MAUI. Detailed descriptions are stated for each file separately below.

** \texttt{pSIRM-MassRanges-ForIncorp\_v3.txt}

This file contains the following information for each intermediates:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Metabolite name, shortened version (\emph{Alanine}, further details below)
\item
  Derivate ( \emph{(3TMS)})
\item
  Lettercode (\emph{Ala})
\item
  Starting mass of the fragment (m\_0, \emph{188})
\item
  End mass of the fragment (m\_end, \emph{191})
\item
  Mass of interest (m\_inc, \emph{190})
\end{itemize}

The metabolite name that has to be defined has to fulfill specific criteria, otherwise MAUI won't be able to extract the correct intermediate. Copy the library name in case you have to add a new metabolite and shorten the name, take care of existing white spaces.

Let's consider these different cases:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Alanine, Aspartic acid: Intermediates and their different derivates, single m\_inc
\item
  Fructose\_: Intermediates with main- and by-products
\item
  Pyruvic acid\_: Unique part of the metabolite name to exclude close related intermediates, e.g.~Pyruvic acid, 3-hydroxy
\item
  Citric acid 275: Multiple mass couples per intermediate
\end{itemize}

** \texttt{Natural\_MIDs\_v3.txt}

You need to define the natural distribution for each intermediate, derivate and defined mass couple. In case of multiple mass couples, e.g.~Citric acid 275, Citric acid 276, you need to add the same MID multiple times.

The following information are listed:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Metabolite name: simplified version
\item
  Derivate (\emph{(2TMS)})
\item
  Mass m/z
\item
  Intensity values
\item
  Mass isotopomer distribution
\end{itemize}

** \texttt{pSIRM-MassRanges-ForQuant\_v3.txt}

This file originiates back to the beginning of the development of pSIRM methodologies. Back then we determined the quantities for metabolites, which areaffected by the incorporation of stable isotopes, by summarising all intensities of the fragment masses from m\_0 to m\_end.

Nowadays we do not use this approach any more. Nevertheless you need to add the information to this file to maintain a sufficient processing using MAUI.

File content:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Metabolite name, taking care of name specifics, described before
\item
  Derivate (\emph{(3TMS)})
\item
  Lettercode
\item
  Starting mass of the fragment m\_0
\item
  End mass of the fragment m\_end
\item
  Mass of interest m\_inc

\section{GC-MS settings}\label{gcms}}

In the following paragraphs details of GC-MS settings are described in detail. The herein described settings have been optimized for cell extracts measured in split-mode 1:5 on the instrument Pegasus 4D-C GC-ToF-MS in 1D mode equiped with an autosampler Gerstel MPS.

\hypertarget{psirm}{%
\chapter{pSIRM experiments}\label{psirm}}

The application of stable isotopes provides a powerful tool to track the activity of metabolic pathways.
the time-dependent and atom-specific routing along a metabolic pathway resolved how substrates like glucose or glutamine are used in order to maintain a certain phenotype and energetic homeostatsis.

We developed an approach called pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM) enabling the quantitative evaluation of metabolite pool sizes and incorporation of stable isotopes, e.g., \(^{13}C_6\)-glucose. A thoughtful setup of the experimental design including the applied substrates and carefull experimental handling are prerequisites for a successful pSIRM experiment. Essential aspects are collected in the below paragraphs along with a number of usefull tweaks.

\hypertarget{experimental-design}{%
\section{Experimental design}\label{experimental-design}}

An \emph{in vitro} pSIRM experiment lasts in total up to three days starting from the cell seeding at day zero. Further along the way up to two media changes should be included until the application of stable isotopes and harvesting the cells maintaining the continouse availability of nutrients and avoiding the accumulation of waste products (Figure \ref(fig:psirm)). The media change four hours prior the harvest is set up in order to give cells time to recover from the mechanical stress of the media change. At the time point of harvest cells should be in a perfect happily state regarding metabolic environment and stress.

Choose carefully the \emph{seeding density of you cells} in the first place. High confluency inducing contact inhibition of cell growth has a strong impact on several cellular processes including the uptake of nutrients. Try to aim for petri dishes with a maximum confluency of 75-80 \%. A pre-experiment including different cell densities for seeding at a number of experimental conditions helps you to get a feeling for the cell growth in general and an expected output of cells at the time point of the harvest. Later one is useful to plan sample extraction and measurement subsequently.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/psirm_harvest.png}
\caption{\label{fig:psirmexp}Experimental design of a pSIRM experiment distuingishing short and long labeling with stable isotopes.}
\end{figure}

For adherent cell cultures only: Include for each experimental condition an additional petri dish that is solely used to determine the cell count at the time point of your harvest. This additional plate ensures a correct determination of absolute quantities and might reduce variation of pool sizes in the statistical analysis\footnote{Pelleting these cells and snap-freezing might give usefull additional samples for western blotting.}. Think carefully about control conditions and include cell culture dishes that are not labeled. These dishes function as a control for your labeling procedure and the natural abundance of isotopes.

\hypertarget{experimental-procedures}{%
\section{Experimental procedures}\label{experimental-procedures}}

There is a slight difference in the protocols for \protect\hyperlink{psirm:adherent}{adherent} and \protect\hyperlink{psirm:suspension}{suspension} cells. Please read instructions and footnotes carefully.

Short\footnote{I would rather recommend this up to 2 min of labeling} and long term labeling procured differ only in the applied solvents during the labeling - either label buffer (\protect\hyperlink{washingbuffer}{LB}) only or a combination of full label medium (LM) and label buffer (LB). Latter one is applied in order to remove extracellular metabolites of the media. Both label buffer and media contain the major nutrients / stable isotopes to keep the main substrates at constant supply at all times (Table \ref{tab:solvent}). During the application of stable isotopes longer than a few minutes cells might sense the absence of further intermediates provided during standard cell culture procedure and and adjust their metabolic program accordingly.

\begin{table}[t]

\caption{\label{tab:solvent}Solvent composition of Full label medium (LM) and label buffer (BF) for a pSIRM experiment labeling with 13C-glucose.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
Solvent & Base & Carbon.source & Supplements\\
\midrule
Full label medium (LM) & DMEM, without glucose, glutamine, pyruvate & 13C-Glc (2.5 g/L)
12C-Gln (2 mM) & small molecules 
(inhibitor, antibiotics)\\
Label buffer (LB) & HEPES (5 mM), NaCl (140 mM), pH 7.4 & 13C-Glc (2.5 g/L)
12C-Gln (2 mM) & \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The quality of your data later heavily relies on the exact handling of the cells and a \emph{consistent timing} throughout the pSIRM experiment. Especially the step removing the LB and quenching the cells should be a matter of a tenth of seconds rather than seconds. It is of great value to perform the cell harvest with a second person.

\hypertarget{protocol-psirm}{%
\section{Protocol pSIRM}\label{protocol-psirm}}

\hypertarget{psirm:adherent}{%
\subsection{Adherent cell cultures}\label{psirm:adherent}}

The herein described protocols are detailed explanations how to perform a pSIRM cell harvest for long term label application.
If you want to label for less than 2 minutes omit solely \emph{omit steps 6-8}.

Materials:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cell culture dishes, max. confluency 80 \%
\item
  Labeling media (LM) supplemented with substrates (5 ml / dish)\footnote{Not required for short term labeling}
\item
  Label buffer (LB) supplemented with substrates (5 ml / dish)
\item
  Ice-cold 50 \% MeOH supplemented with 2 ug/ul cinnamic acid
\item
  2x 5 ml pipette and tips\footnote{Highly recommended, makes labeling and harvest super quick}
\item
  Beaker
\item
  Ice
\item
  15 ml falcons (chloroform resistant)
\item
  Cell lifter
\item
  Biological waste bin next to your bench
\end{itemize}

Procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Pre-warm LB and LM in the water bath
\item
  Take a number of petri dishes (condition-wise including all biol. replicates)
\item
  Discard cell culture media
\item
  Carefully add \emph{long term labeling} LM OR \emph{short term labeling}: LB
\item
  Incubate cells on the bench or in an incubator
\item
  Discard LM (beaker)
\item
  Add immediatly 5 ml of LB
\item
  Rotate dish once in order to cover complete surface
\item
  Meanwhile 2nd person get prepared with 5 ml ice-cold MeOH
\item
  Discard LB into beaker and \emph{immediatly} 2nd person quenches with ice-cold MeOH
\item
  Collect cell extracts using cell lifter
\item
  Transfer cell extracts into 15 ml falcons
\item
  Store falcons on ice until further processing
\end{enumerate}

Repeat this procedure (step 6-10) for all dishes of a single condition first. Once MeOH is added metabolic processes are interrupted and cell extracts can be collected with the help of cell lifter without rush and subsequently transfered to 15 ml falcon and stored on ice until further processing (see chapter \protect\hyperlink{ccextraction_meoh}{Cell extraction methanolic extracts}).

Determine the cell count using your additional petri dishes for each condition.

\hypertarget{psirm:suspension}{%
\subsection{Supension cell cultures}\label{psirm:suspension}}

Materials:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cell culture flasks
\item
  Labeling media (LM) supplemented with substrates
\item
  5 ml pipette and tips\footnote{Highly recommended, makes labeling and harvest super quick}
\item
  1 ml pipette
\item
  Beaker
\item
  paper tissues
\item
  Liquid nitrogen
\item
  15 ml falcons
\item
  1.5 ml eppendorf tubes
\item
  Biological waste bin next to your bench
\end{itemize}

Procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Pre-warm LM in the water bath
\item
  Determine the cell count of your cell suspension(s)
\item
  Take aliquots of \(10-15e+6\) cells and transfer into 15 ml falcon
\item
  Spin down cells very gently 300 g, 2 min at room temperature
\item
  Discard media into beaker
\item
  Resuspend cells gently in three-times 1 ml\footnote{To generate three replicates}
\item
  Incubate and keep warm
\item
  Fractionate cell supension in three eppendorf tubes (3x 1 ml each)
\item
  Spin down quickly in top-bench centrifuge\footnote{Most of the times 30 s are already enough}
\item
  Discard media blandtly on paper tissues
\item
  Snap-freeze immediatly in liquid nitrogen
\item
  Store cells until further processing (see chapter \protect\hyperlink{ccextraction_susp}{Cell extraction suspension cells})
\end{enumerate}

The important step here to be quick is the alquotation of the cell suspension and subsequent spin down in the table centrifuge. Suspension cells are rather small, nevertheless \(3e+6\) cells per extract are a good starting point for GC-MS measurements.

\hypertarget{hints-notes}{%
\section{Hints \& notes}\label{hints-notes}}

\begin{itemize}

  The only way to be reproducible and fast is to team up with a second person.
\item
  Keep timing consistently through the experiment.
\item
  Keep substrate concentrations constant throughout the experiment in all solutions.
\item
  Supplement one stable isotopic labeled substrate with all remaining substrates in non-labeled form.

  Think about nutrient levels in your cell culture and your experimental conditions. Maybe you want to change things to physiological levels.
\item
  Add additional plate to each condition in order to have material for western blotting and others.
\item
  Check carefully the confluency of your dishes and determine seeding densities for different conditions.
\item
  In case of small molecule inhibitors: Try to avoid to solve them in DMSO - strong impact on chromatography.
